          Your request will be checked against the information in our user  database. If you have not yet been notified that your application and  dues have been processed, your information will not yet be online. That  means that the system will not yet be able to process your request for  access to the members’s area of the site.

        <p>Hints:</p>
        <p><strong>Username</strong> can be just about anything you like, but should be at least three  characters and it must be unique. We suggest that you use something you  will easily remember, such as the username portion of your email  address (<strong>user</strong> is the username in the address <strong>user@somewhere.com</strong>).</p>
        <p><strong>Passwords</strong> can also be whatever you'd like, but should be at least three  characters (numbers are OK). If you forget your username and/or  password, go to the Membership page, where you can have the information  emailed to you.<br />
