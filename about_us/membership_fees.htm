          <blockquote>
              <p>Currency = <strong>$40 CDN</strong><br />

                Payment Options - money order or cash<br />
                (While there is some inherent risk to sending cash in the mail, it is the only method that avoids extremely high bank fees.)</p>

          <p>You may register on line and then mail your fee to the address at the  bottom of this page or download the standard Registration Form below  and include it with your payment.</p></td>
        <td width="50%" valign="top"><p>With PayPal or credit card, there is only one rate -<strong>$40 CDN</strong></p>
            <p>To use a credit card, you will have to proceed through the PayPal process. Or you can use your own PayPal account.</p>
            <p>PayPal, in conjunction with your bank or credit card will automatically  make currency conversion for you with no high end bank fees attached. <br />
                <br />
              You do not have to register with PayPal directly if you are using a  credit card. To make a direct deposit from your bank account, you will  have to have a PayPal account.<br />
              <br />
              If you use the PayPal method, you will be transferred off this site to the fully secured PayPal pages.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center" class="style3">VERY&nbsp; IMPORTANT!</p>
        <p>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> make a PayPal payment by way of email. You <strong>MUST</strong> follow the &quot;On Line Registration Form&quot; link below for payment transfer to work correctly. You will have the choice in this process to pay with your credit card or directly from your personal PayPal account.</p>
		
		<p>You should only make a PayPal payment through the SGGEE link to ensure a secure payment transfer.  Within your PayPal account you will be able to select your payment options based on your personal settings. If you follow an alternate process, you may experience problems or time delays in the processing of your membership. SGGEE accepts no responsibility for your use of an incorrect payment method.</p>
