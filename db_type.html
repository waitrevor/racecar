    <h2>Type 1 Data - Member Submissions</h2>
    <p>This is, to the  extent provided by our members, a listing of data on the descendants of  those ancestors (generally German - Volhynia or German - Russian  Poland). If you wish to contribute to this database, you can send your  GEDCOM file to <a href="mailto:databases@sggee.org">databases@sggee.org</a> as an attachment. If you do so, we invite you to include all persons in  your database that are in anyway connected to Germans from Poland or  Volhynia, or their ancestors from any of the German provinces. We would  ask however, that you either eliminate all lines that do not have such  a connection, or at least advise us what those lines are so that we can  eliminate them before we enter your data into our database. If you wish  to participate with your data, please include yourself linked into the  data (at least your name, including maiden name if married female) so  that we can determine how you are related to others in the database,  assuming your data shows a link to others. <br>
        <br>
      We have a volunteer who compiles submitted data into our huge database.  It is extremely helpful if you download our <a href="../about_us/db_submittal_instruct.pdf" target="_blank">submittal instructions </a>and  follow them closely before you send it to us. This will greatly  simplify the work this volunteer has to do. We would also encourage you  to use common spellings and equivalencies where possible in accord with  our <a href="../research/AlternateChristianNames.pdf" target="_blank">given names equivalency list</a> and our <a href="../research/AlternateSurnamesDatabaseSubstantiated.pdf" target="_blank">standard surnames list</a>.<br>
  <br>
      Remember also that, if you do not want any information about living  people to appear, include at least a year of birth so that our system  recognizes them. Refer also to the <a href="../about_us/SGGEEPrivacyPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">SGGEE privacy policy</a> (pdf).</p>

    <h2>Type 2 Data - Original Records</h2>
    <p>These  records have been entered into a genealogy program, and are thus linked  to the extent that we have been able to discover links. We have tried  our best to make only the links that are nearly certain, but, especialy  as the database grows and additional merges are made, there may be  errors in the database. Accordingly, you are advised that it is your  responsibility to confirm that the data is both correct in content, and  correct in its links to other records. Do not accept our work as  definitive. If you have time to donate to this important work of  extracting data from original records, please also send an email to <a href="mailto:databases@sggee.org">databases@sggee.org</a>.</p>
