                    <p>We encourage you to read the material below to learn about your membership privileges and responsibilities. Then go to our Membership Rates page by clicking the "Register" link at the end to find pricing and submittal details. Membership can be obtained via regular postal service, registered PayPal, or credit card PayPal.</p>

                    <h2>Getting Information</h2>
                    <p>All email queries regarding membership or site access should be addressed to <a href="mailto:membership@sggee.org">membership@sggee.org</a> .</p>
                    <p>All correspondence, newsletters, Journals, notices, etc. will be made available to members via our Society web site. Those members not connected to the Internet and unable to receive email will receive such materials via conventional postal services. It is the responsibility of each member to inform the Membership Committee Chairperson of any changes in email or postal addresses.</p>

                    <h2>Membership Term</h2>
                    <p>Membership is for the year January through December. Dues are not prorated, so when they are received between January through September, membership renewal is required for the forthcoming calendar year. New memberships received in October through December, however, will be applied to the forthcoming year(s).
                        <br>
                        <br>The rationale on which this policy is based is that, regardless of the time of year a membership is received, all the benefits, resources, research aids, databases and newsletters published to date by SGGEE are available immediately to the new member on the SGGEE web site. In other words, there is no "penalty" for becoming a member of SGGEE late in the calendar year rather than early.</p>

                    <p>These instructions apply to establishing your member login on the new SGGEE website, effective September 2024. Once you have received acknowledgement of your membership, you will need to set up your login username and password. Your username will be the email address used to establish your SGGEE membership. Here are the <a href="/support/set-reset-password.pdf" target="_blank">instructions</a> for setting up your user account on the new website.</p>

Once you have your email address, you can follow the process in these <a href="/support/set-reset-password.pdf" target="_blank">instructions</a> to reset your password.

                    <h2>Submitting Data</h2>
                    <p>Maximum membership benefit is derived from members who submit data for our Master Pedigree Database. We hope that you will share your pedigree or family group data with us for including in our Master Pedigree Database. Due to the complexity of merging new data into our huge database, we have found it necessary to develop <a href="about_us/db_submittal_instruct.pdf">Submission Standards</a> (pdf). Please comply with these Standards before submitting any data. Electronic data submissions can be emailed to <a href="mailto:databases@sggee.org">databases@sggee.org</a> or hardcopies can be sent to the address at the bottom of this page via regular mail.</p>
                    <p>In addition, it is helpful if everyone uses the same standard for place names within their data submission. The standard as a <a href="/research/village_guidelines_detailed.pdf">detailed document</a>. There is also an <a href="/research/village_guidelines_short.pdf">appendix</a> to it. Both are in pdf format.</p>
                    <p>When you submit your data, you can save us a lot of time and effort if you only send us the Germans in your data (meaning those with any German blood, AND their descendants and spouses) in your data.Ã‚Â&nbsp;Ã‚Â&nbsp; In order to trim the database that you send to us, please follow the <a href="/about_us/trim_database.pdf">this guide</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> You should only make a PayPal payment through the SGGEE link to ensure a secure payment transfer. Within your PayPal account you will be able to select your payment options based on your personal settings.
