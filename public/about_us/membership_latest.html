    <p>SGGEE welcomes new and returning members! Working together, we can preserve our shared history.<br>
    </p>
  <ul>	<li>Membership runs January through December</li>
  <li>For new members; if you join during or after the annual convention, your membership is valid through the following year.</li>
  <li>For returning members who have not been active members in the previous year; if you join during or after the annual convention, your membership is valid through the following year.</li>
  <li>Your membership gives you access to all members-only areas of the website, including the Journal and private databases.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Membership Application</b></p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Applications must be sent via the membership link and payments made using PayPal</b> using a credit card or debit card. Paper checks, bank transfers, cash or other methods are not accepted due to the additional handling required and the delay they cause in processing your membership.</li>
  <li>Once your application and payment are received, you will be notified by email and provided details on creating your login and password for the website. NOTE: In all correspondence about your SGGEE membership, you must use the email address with which you register. It is your responsibility to ensure your email address is active and to notify the membership volunteers about any changes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have questions or updates to your membership, email <router-link to="mailto:membership-sggee@googlegroups.com ">membership-sggee@googlegroups.com.</router-link></p>
  <b>Additional information for members</b>
  <p><b>Recover a username or password:</b> applies to active members only. Go to the <a href="https://www.sggee.org/members/MembersIndex.html">login page. Enter your email address in the field labeled "Send username and/or reset forgotten password." You <u>must</u> use the email address that you have associated with your SGGEE account. If your account is active, your username will be sent to you along with a link that you can use to reset your password.</a></p><a href="https://www.sggee.org/members/MembersIndex.html">
  </a><p><a href="https://www.sggee.org/members/MembersIndex.html"><b>Submitting genealogical data:</b> Maximum membership benefit is derived from members who submit data for our Master Pedigree Database. Due to the complexity of merging new data into our huge database, we have found it necessary to develop </a><a href="#/about_us/db_submittal_instruct.pdf">Submission Standards (pdf)</a>. Please comply with these standards before submitting any data. Electronic submissions (preferred) can be emailed to <router-link to="mailto:databases-sggee@googlegroups.com">databases-sggee@googlegroups.com. Hard copies can be mailed to SGGEE’s postal address; note that using regular mail will significantly delay the receipt of your information.</router-link></p>
  <p>When you submit your data, <b>only send us the Germans in your data</b> (meaning those with any German blood, and their descendants and spouses). Please follow the <a href="/about_us/trim_database.pdf">this guide</a>.
  It is helpful if everyone uses the same standard for place names within their data submission. The standard is found in a <a href="#/research/village_guidelines_detailed.pdf">detailed document</a>, which also contains appendices on How to find locations and Read Transcriptions of Cyrillic.
  </p><p><b>Privacy:</b> By joining or renewing your membership, you agree to abide by the <a href="#/about_us/SGGEEBylaws_Sep2013.pdf">bylaws</a> of the Society and our <a href="#/about_us/privacy_policy.html">privacy policy. It is critical that you understand how SGGEE collects and uses your personal identifying information as well as any genealogical data you choose to provide. Please read our </a><a href="#/about_us/data_collection_guidelines.html">Data Collection Guidelines</a>.</p>
  <p><em>Membership does not entitle you to copy other members’ genealogical data for distribution or posting elsewhere without the owner's permission. Doing so could result in cancellation of your membership.</em></p>
  <p>If an active or inactive member does not inform SGGEE of email address changes, you may not be able to contact someone you find in the database. This is beyond SGGEE’s control.</p>
