      <h2>Register Using PayPal or Credit Card</h2>
      <p>With PayPal or credit card, there is only one rate - <strong>$40 CDN</strong></p>
      <p>To use a credit card, you will have to proceed through the PayPal process. Or you can use your own PayPal account.</p>
      <p>PayPal will automatically make currency conversion for you with no high bank fees.</p>
      <p>You do not need to register with PayPal directly if you are using a credit card. To make a direct deposit from your bank account, you will need a PayPal account.</p>

      <h3>Important:</h3>
      <i>
        <p>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> make a PayPal payment via email. You <strong>MUST</strong> follow the <a href="https://f8s.co/22i4" target="_blank">"Online Registration Form"</a> link for payment transfer to work correctly. You will be able to choose between paying with your credit card or through PayPal.</p>
        <p>Please make your PayPal payment through the SGGEE link to ensure secure payment. SGGEE does not accept responsibility for incorrect payment methods.</p>
