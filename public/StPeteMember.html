  <h2>Database Information</h2>
  <p>See the <a href="#/databases.html" target="_blank">Databases</a> page for explanatory information about the VKP database.</p>
  
  <h3>Births</h3>
  <p>This database includes:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Births for the parishes of Zhitomir, Rozyszcze, Heimtal (all in Volhynia), Kiev, and Podolia for years 1833 to 1885, with some years missing, extracted from FHL microfilms of St. Petersburg Archive records.</li>
      <li>Additional data extracted from online scans of the AGAD register books:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Births for Rozyszcze parish for the years 1862 to 1914.</li>
        <li>Confirmations for Rozyszcze parish for the years 1862 to 1935.</li>
        <li>Births for Wladimir-Wolynsk parish for the years 1891 to 1899, 1902, 1908.</li>
        <li>Confirmations for Wladimir-Wolynsk parish for the years 1892 to 1902.</li>
        <li>Births for Lutzk parish for 1899 to 1910.</li>
        <li>Confirmations for Torczyn parish for 1931 to 1937.</li>
        <li>Births for 20 kantorates for varying years, mostly in the Rowno and Tutschin area.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> A search will bring up both Births and Confirmations. A confirmation is denoted by the letter segment “Confirm” in the “Film or Item” column. For example, “AGAD Sygn. 32 / 1862 Confirm” denotes a confirmation in the year 1862; the source of the record is AGAD Sygn. 32. For Confirmations, the Event Place has the form “B: xxx, C: yyy”, where xxx stands for the Birth Place, and yyy stands for either the Confirmation Place or the Residence Place depending on which one is given in the confirmation record.</p>

  <h3>Marriages</h3>
  <p>This database includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Marriages for the parishes of Zhitomir, Rozyszcze, Heimtal (all in Volhynia), Kiev, and Podolia for years 1833 to 1885, with some years missing, extracted from FHL microfilms of St. Petersburg Archive records.</li>
    <li>Additional data extracted from online scans of register books held in AGAD:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Marriages for Rozyszcze parish for the years 1862 to 1909 and 1919 to 1938 (1907 is missing).</li>
      <li>Marriages for Wladimir-Wolynsk parish for the years 1891 to 1899, 1907, 1915 to 1935.</li>
      <li>Marriages for Lutzk parish for the years 1899 to 1935.</li>
      <li>Marriages (based on records of banns; no marriage date and place) for 20 kantorates for varying years, mostly in the Rowno and Tutschin area.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> For the St. Petersburg Archive marriages only the names of the groom and bride and the date of marriage are given. The AGAD records are full marriage records containing the names and places of residence of the groom and bride, their ages and birthplaces, their parents’ names and/or name of previous spouse.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The spelling of names may vary due to many causes, so it is desirable to check for possible variants when searching for a surname. For example, when searching for Buelau, also search for Buelow, Bilau, Bilow, Bylow, etc. In some instances, the surname in the VKP databases is “corrected” to the more common spelling when a misleading spelling occurs in the church record.</p>
