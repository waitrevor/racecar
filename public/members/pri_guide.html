    <h2><strong>Original Records Indices</strong></h2>
    <p><u><a href="#/members/parish-records-idx/search">Parish Records Index (PRI)&nbsp;database</a></u> (last update  February 2012 - about 368,800 names in database)<br>
          <br>
        SGGEE&nbsp;has created a searchable database of names and other vital  statistics data from the indices of the original Polish and Russian  civil and parish records. See Job Central for a listing of the parishes  included. In some parishes the volunteers are  only extracting names from the indices, while in other cases the  volunteers are extracting all the data in the original record. Note  also that our database includes some personal files from a few of  our members, and that data contains some records from parishes that have  not been entered into the Job Central listing of parishes being worked  on.<br>
        <br>
        Permission has now been received from the Polish Archives to show <u>only the indices</u> for these records on the SGGEE&nbsp;website. An effort is being made to  convert those records that have more than just index information into  the Pedigree database, but until that is done, you can continue to ask  us to do a search of the master database to see if there is additional  information on any names that are of interest to you. Just send an  email to <a href="mailto:databases-sggee@googlegroups.com">databases-sggee@googlegroups.com</a> and be sure to mention that you want a specific search of the PRI  database for a specific name, including the registration number and  parish name.
