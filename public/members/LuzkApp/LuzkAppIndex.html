    <p>A  copy of this document was obtained from the Archive in Luzk by Howard  Krushel and George Maser during one of their ancestral tours through  this region. It contains the record of 1,149 tenants, mostly German,  whose land and property rights were terminated in the district of Luzk  in 1915.</p>
    <p><strong>Credits</strong>: Contributing to the translation  of these documents and their preparation for publication were Julia  Danneker, Arvid Pohl, Kurt Arndt, Henry Broderson, Garnet Marshall,  Bill Fife, and Gary Warner. John Marsch coordinated the translation  project.</p>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alphabetical order</strong> - The original document contained sequential entries within groupings  arranged alphabetically in accord with Russian Cyrillic characters. For  our site, we arranged the names in alphabetical order according to  Roman characters. There is therefore no "C" section. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Transliteration</strong> - Recreating names and  surnames recorded in Russian Cyrillic is a difficult task that  sometimes requires a bit of guessing. For example, should a name that  is transliterated precisely as Aysner be recorded as Asner or Eisner?  For this reason, you MUST consider phoenetic equivalents for the name  you may be searching. You may in fact want to browse over every name on  the list just to ensure that you don't miss a possible equivalent. Most  of the names should be readily recognizable, even with some variant in  spelling. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>H vs. G</strong>: There is no Russian Cyrillic  character that is directly equivalent to H. Therefore, many places  where H should be seen, you will find a G. The name recorded as  Reingold should obviously be interpreted as Reinhold. Folkengagen  should be Falkenhagen, and so on. If your surname of interest starts  with H, be sure to also look in the G column. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Multiple land descriptions:</strong> Some tenants  occupied more than one piece of land, sometimes even in another  village. Such land might be owned by the same owner or different ones.  If applicable, such data is shown in subsequent rows under the tenant  name. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Interpreting the columns and abbreviations:</strong><br>
          <em>Seq. Num.</em> - This is the original sequential number of the entry. You will need  this if you ever want to refer back to the original document to verify  information.<br>
          <em>Register Number</em> - This is a numbering  system applied by the authorities. The use for this number is not known  but it may cross-reference some other document.<br>
          <em>Tenant</em> - This is the name of the tenant. Note that in some cases you can find  the name of the tenants father as well. Example: Schulz, August  Gotlibov = August Schulz [son] of Gottlieb .<br>
          (w) = widow<br>
          <em>Location</em> - Shows the village where the land was located.<br>
          (c/v) = village with church<br>
          (c) = colony or settlement<br>
          (h) = house<br>
          House with addition is not clearly defined. The addition may have been  a barn or stables or a tool shed. Since barns or stables or sheds are  not otherwise listed, they would be included as additions.<br>
          There is no translation for "Shoyna" though granary has been used to  define it. A Shoyna was actually a building divided into three parts.  Two end parts were used to store sheaves of grain for threshing at a  later time. The centre part was used as a threshing floor using flails.  It had huge gates on each side of the building so that a load of  sheaves could be driven in, unloaded, and driven out again.<br>
          <em>Value of Buildings</em> -<br>
          (R) = rubels<br>
          (K) = kopek<br>
          (n/i) = not indicated<br>
          (-- or n/k) = not known<br>
          <em>Land Description</em> - Column (a) shows the number of parcels of land and column (b) shows the amount.<br>
          D = Desjatins (area);  1 D = 2.7 acres<br>
          S = Sajen (length);  1 S = 2.13 metres or 2.3 yards<br>
        <em>Land Ownership</em> - Names of the land owners are shown. In some cases, a single parcel of  land might be split between several owners. In that case the amount in  desjatins or sajen (D or S) is noted in front of that name. </li>
      </ul>
