  <h1 class="centered-content">Sequential Sort of St. Pete Database</h1>

  <p>
      The original database is hosted on the Odessa3 web site. Our version allows for more extensive search opportunities.
  </p>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
      This special search tool will assist in determining the location of a village in the St. Petersburg Volhynian records, especially if it has a common name like Alexandrowka which can be found in numerous locations. Since it is sorted by film and page number, it is organized in the same way as the original parish records, and outlines the route taken by the pastor in collecting the information. The results page will show your village name in conjunction with others in the immediate area, thereby giving you a precise location.
      <strong>NOTE that you can also use this database to find relatives in adjoining villages.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
      To aid in search engine speed, and because the whole purpose is to obtain a sequential listing, sorting for this table is not available.
  </p>


  <h2>Special Instructions for This Search</h2>

  <p>
      Step 1: Enter the name of the person you are looking for and search for them. On the results page, you will find the film number and page number of the entry. These numbers will have
      <strong>leading zeroes</strong> that are very important in step 2. Write down the numbers exactly as you see them with the correct number of zeroes in the front.
  </p>

  <p>
      Step 2: Return to this page and enter the film number
      <strong>and</strong> page number with the correct number of zeroes in the front. When the results page comes up, you will see all the entries for that page.
  </p>

  <p>
      Step 3: Look at the names of the villages that appear both before and after your village of interest. By determining their location on a map, you will also know where your village is. If your village appears at the top or the bottom of the page, you will have to do another search by increasing or decreasing the page number by 1 so that you can see the results on that page.
