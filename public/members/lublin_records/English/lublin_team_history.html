    <h2><strong>A Unique Collaboration with Trinity Lutheran Church in Lublin</strong></h2>
    <strong>How Things Got Started</strong>
    <p>In  early 2004 the LDS had scanned the archives of the Lutheran church in  Lublin as part of a new effort to institute a new digital platform for  dispersal of genealogical records available via the Family History  Centers. During the following years this promising development for  access to Lublin records seemed to stall among the vast array of issues  the LDS faces in trying to digitize their entire microfilm collection.  To abide by an agreement made with the Lutheran Consistory Office in  Warsaw, the LDS provided on 71 DVDs the complete archive to the Warsaw  Consistory and to the church in Lublin.<br>
        <br>
      After two  years it became evident that the LDS might not make these records  available to the public in the foreseeable future. Plans to digitize  their existing microfilm collection proved to be a significant obstacle  holding up the release of the Lublin archive. In the mean time this  valuable resource continued to sit in the vaults of Salt Lake City .  With the help of an advocate who spoke Polish, SGGEE members we able to  contact by phone pastor Dariusz Chwastek and Jadwiga Kawiak, archive  caretaker of the Lublin church, to inquire if they had been able to use  the disks given to them by the LDS. Because this church has few  financial resources to upgrade their outdated computer, they could not  read DVDs. They suggested we contact the Consistory Office where  computer resources were current.<br>
  <br>
      From the consistory in Warsaw we learned that the files on the disks  could be opened with any photo-manipulating program and that the disks  consisted simply of a large collection of photographic files organized  into folders. As we had suspected, the names of each file gave  insignificant clues as to what was contained in each photographic scan.  Realizing that no special software was needed to view the files we then  discussed the situation with the pastor. The church could not use the  disks since their computer was too out-dated, but even if they had a  capable computer they would not know where to find specific records  because the file names were represented by a nebulous code produced by  the scanning software. This posed our next obstacle since the church  could not use these disks thereby benefiting no one.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <strong>Partnering with the Trinity Evangelical Church of Lublin</strong>
    <p>Fortunately,  Pastor Chwastek was very open to working with SGGEE to make this  archive readily searchable in such a manner that the church could know  where to find any record of interest. Pastor Chwastek had envisioned  having an online search tool where anyone could search an index for  names and request specific records from the church. SGGEE then proposed  to assemble a team of volunteers to index these records with the  understanding that we would not duplicate these disks such that once  the project was completed, the church and Consistory Office in Warsaw  would retain the only complete copies of this digital archive (with the  exception of the LDS). The SGGEE board of directors unanimously  approved the transfer of sufficient funds to Lublin Trinity Evangelical  Church for them to purchase a suitably equipped computer, printer,  scanner, and a few other accessories. In Lublin the church board  considered this offer of collaboration and eagerly agreed to our  conditions commenting that it was generous of SGGEE to offer this help  and provide financial support to upgrade their computer. Certainly,  this equipment would also be used for standard church office  activities, but this upgrade would enable them to work with the digital  archive.<br>
        <br>
      There was great excitement once the church  purchased and set up the computer since they finally had equipment that  was current and could effectively access the internet. The pastor spent  several weeks copying each disk to their secondary hard drive and  studying what was contained in this collection. He also proceeded to  make a second copy of all disks which would be sent to us for the  indexing project. This familiarity allowed him to make a list  describing what types of records were contained on each disk (see the <a href="disk_descriptions.pdf">Disk Descriptions file</a>)  so we could choose disks we wanted to work on first. The files on the  DVDs have no particular organization to them other than one disk  corresponds to one parish book or a particular collection of folders  containing detached records or documentation.<br>
  <br>
      Due to  the vast numbers of records found on each disk (usually about 1,000 to  3,000 records per disk) it will take several years for the volunteers  to complete this indexing project. Undoubtedly many treasures sit among  these records as the volunteers are quickly finding out. The Team  Lublin volunteers all have ancestors and other relatives who lived near  Lublin and many new discoveries are coming forward pertinent to their  own families. &nbsp;This project is thus expected to benefit anyone with  Lutheran ties to Lubelskie. Furthermore, since this area was a transit  point for many Germans who moved on to Volhynia, many of the families  can be found among these records during their temporary stay in this  region.<br>
  <br>
      Another unexpected asset we are quickly finding is that fairly detailed  information of genealogical interest is found for the deportation years  during and just after World War I. Apparently the reporting of births  and deaths that occurred in Soviet territory was made by the surviving  Germans who returned. This served to document the many deaths that  occurred during those stressful years. If one searches for the term  “Russland” in the location field, these deportation-related records  will be revealed.<br>
  <br>
      It is not known which other churches in Poland the LDS has visited to  digitize their archives. It is expected that this project will serve as  a prototype example of what can be accomplished if the church is  willing to work with others to avail their archives to the world-wide  community.</p>

    <strong>Acknowledgements</strong>
    <p>SGGEE  is grateful to pastor Dr. Dariusz Chwastek and Mrs. Jadwiga Kawiak for  their cooperation in establishing this provocative project. The  volunteers contributing to the indexing of the records are indicated in  the table below.<br>

      If you would like to join this project please contact Karl Krueger (<a href="mailto:dabookk54@yahoo.com">dabookk54@yahoo.com</a>).  A computer that can read DVDs and some familiarity with spreadsheets  (Excel is most beneficial) are necessary. Familiarity with German,  Polish, or Russian (our greatest need) in particular are helpful.</p>
