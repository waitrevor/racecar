    <h2><strong>General Information</strong></h2>
    <p>To  learn more about how the Lublin Research Team project evolved and how  it cooperated with the Lublin Trinity Evangelical Church, please visit  our <a href="#/members/lublin_records/English/lublin_team_history.html">Lublin Research History</a> page.</p>
    <p>BEFORE  USING THE LUBLIN SEARCH UTILITY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ AND UNDERSTAND  THESE INSTRUCTIONS. You may want to print them out to have at hand  while doing the searches. Note that many of the reference links  referred to in this discussion are at the top of this page for your  convenience as you become familiar with the use of this search utility.</p>
    <p><span>This  page is used to search for records found in the Lublin Trinity  Evangelical Church Digital Archive.&nbsp; After searching the database,  most records can be viewed at <a href="https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-899H-8D2L?owc=QZW1-3TY%3A1588932888%2C1588932897%3Fcc%3D2564996&amp;wc=QZW1-QHN%3A1588932888%2C1589087960%2C1589087958%2C1589087957%3Fcc%3D2564996&amp;cc=2564996" target="_blank">FamilySearch</a> </span>without the need to hold an account. We have posted instructions for finding records of interest as presented by our Lublin database search engine. The link to this <a href="#/members/lublin_records/English/FS_instructional_page.html">instructional page</a> is included in the upper right box above for your convenience. Eventually we plan to include direct hyperlinks in the database search results page to the corresponding FamilySearch page presenting the image folder for each identified record. </p>
    <p>Records  are either in German, Polish, or Russian. Disks 1-20 are of the  Napoleonic format (1838-1889) and are written in either Polish or  Russian. Most records on disks 21-71 are in German but many Polish or  Russian documents are found as well. Additional Napoleonic records may  also be found such as those from the Konskowola parish. A more in depth  discussion of the records encountered in this archive can be found on  the <a href="#/members/lublin_records/English/record_types.html">Examples of Record Types</a> page.</p>
    <p>This represents a  project that has taken the effort of over ten years of many volunteers. A description of what is found in  different disks / folders including color coding for the progress of  indexing is found in the <a href="disk_descriptions.pdf">Lublin Disk Descriptions</a> file. A listing of disks included in the database and the running tally of numbers are provided on the <a href="data_inclusion.pdf">Data Inclusion Summary</a>. </p>
    <p>The  searchable database, when completed, will point to most documents in  the Lublin Digital Archive. These are primarily birth / baptism  records, death records, and marriage records. Occasionally other  accompanying documents associated with people found in the former  records are included and these documents are included in the file number filed for the pertinent record or in the Special NOtes field of the Search Results. The  records extend from 1838 to 1959 (years 1840-1845 are lacking),  although virtually all Germans left this region in 1940 through the  action of <a href="http://www.volhynia.com/res-ewz.html">Einwandererzentralstelle</a>. To protect the privacy of individuals who may still be alive, FamilySearch has not included any  image folder from the original digital archive that contained birth records after 1913. Our database includes all records but births occuring more recently than 90 years ago, where no corresponding death record for that individual was found. In such cases  the given name is indicated as "Living". To summarize, most deaths and virtually all marriages are included in the FamilySearch Lublin library, but births after 1913 are not accessible. In many cases the indicator for a folder of alegata after 1913 may have the descriptor "births" in Polish (Urodzenia) leading the FamilySearch staff to believe those records should not be displayed. If that folder included death records then those records will also be omitted from the library. Often  alegata for marriages after 1913 have copies of birth records that precede 1913 and these aliegata likewise will be missing from the online library. We will attempt to communicate this concern with FamilySearch to assure them such folders should be included since it was only the marriage, not the birth, of the individuals indicated that occured after 1913. </p>

    <h2><strong>Nature of the Data</strong></h2>
    <p>Specific data elements have been used to construct this database. These data elements and their descriptions include:</p>
    <p>1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Name (P) (as spelled in Polish or translated from Russian by the transcriber)</p>
    <p>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Name (P)&nbsp;&nbsp; (same as 1 above)</p>
    <p>3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Name (D) (a typical German spelling is given here)</p>
    <p>4-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Name (D)&nbsp; (same as  3 above)</p>
    <p>5-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event Type (B=birth/christening, D=death, M=marriage, X=other)</p>
    <p>6-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Month (Gregorian calendar month that <strong>the record was written or event occurred</strong>)</p>
    <p>7-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Year (Gregorian calendar year that <strong>the record was written or event occurred</strong>)</p>
    <p>8-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father  (Given name of the father - German equivalent only)</p>
    <p>9-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother or Bride (P) (as described for Polish names in 1 above)</p>
    <p>10-&nbsp; Mother or Bride (D) (German equivalent as described in 3 above)</p>
    <p>11-&nbsp; Village (where the family or husband resided or where the death occurred)</p>
    <p>12-&nbsp; Disk (can be from 1 – 71) - <strong>This value is important to locate records at FamilySearch </strong></p>
    <p>13-&nbsp; Folder (folder on the disk in which the record is found) - <strong>This value is important to locate records at FamilySearch </strong></p>
    <p>14-&nbsp; File (file identifier for this record) - <strong>This value is important to narrow your search for the appropriate image contained within the folder link at FamilySearch </strong></p>
    <p>15-&nbsp; Reg. # (Register number for the record. Many files / FamilySearch images have multiple records)</p>
    <p>16-&nbsp; Groom’s Parents (names are the German equivalents)</p>
    <p>17-&nbsp; Bride’s Parents (names are the German equivalents)</p>
    <p>18-  Spouse(s)  (names are the German equivalents)</p>
    <p>19-&nbsp;Special Notes (optional remarks pertinent to the information on the record)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Other Tips and Comments</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Searching Event Type</strong><br>
      The search utility varies depending on the Event Type that you are  searching for. Only data elements relevant to a search for that Event  Type are available to search. For example, you cannot search for  Bride’s Parents on death records as there is no bride on a death  record. Documents that are of the “Other” Event Type are searched only  as births. Last and given names are included on those documents.</p>
    <p><strong>Searching By Year(s)</strong><br>
      Years can be searched by including a single year.</p>
    <p><strong>Villages</strong><br>
      Villages from the Lubelskie province have been given standardized spellings. Please check the <a href="lublin_villages_list.pdf">Lubelskie Village List</a> to know how a village should be entered into this optional search box.  Some records include locations outside of the Lubelskie province (such  as death records from the World War I deportation period) where  spellings have not been standardized.<br>
  <br>
      The parish in  Kamien was started in 1876 at which time people living in the more  eastern and southern sectors of the Lubelskie province tended to report  here (see the <a href="lubelskie_region_map.pdf">Lublin and Kamien Parish Boundaries Map</a>).  The records in this archive show a noticeable under-representation from  these villages. The Napoleonic records of Disks 1-20 show this  transition starting after 1875 where only towns represented within the  Lublin boundaries are retained (except for occasional marriage records  where the families went to Lublin rather than Kamien). It is hoped that  greater coverage of the Kamien sector will be found as more disks from  21-71 get completed.</p>
    <p><strong>Searching by Name</strong><br>
      When  searching for Names the complete name need not be given. This allows  for greater flexibility in finding pertinent records that might not  have an exact spelling. Although the use of “Polish” and “German  equivalent” names may seem redundant, this was necessary to in effect  standardize how names should be written (in German) as many pastors or  kantors over 100 years often had their own convention of spelling  names.&nbsp; Having both versions of the names spelled out also helps the  church staff verify that they have found the correct record with the  expected people listed.&nbsp; Names that are of Polish or Russian/Ukrainian  origin generally were kept as written.</p>
    <p><strong>Stillborn Cases<br>
    </strong>Babies  that were stillborn or died shortly after birth (and not given a name)  are found in either birth or death records. For consistency in this  database all such cases are indexed as deaths with the given name  “stillborn {male/female}”.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Entries Containing Question Marks or Brackets</strong><br>
      Some search results include names of people or towns with embedded  question marks. This is because these handwritten records can be  difficult to accurately interpret if the transcriber had sloppy  penmanship.&nbsp; Particularly for records in Cyrillic it can be difficult  to distinguish among several possible letters or combinations of  letters.<br>
  <br>
      Other entries may have brackets [ ] surrounding a name. This  corresponds to information that was not included on the record but this  information could be deduced from other records.</p>
    <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>
      As a final note, to protect the confidentiality of those likely to  still be alive, identities of people who were born 90 years ago (after 1920 - 1926 as our extraction of this data proceeded during 2010-16) will not  be revealed unless an accompanying death record was also found. A  search for birth records will reveal any potentially living person born  in 1920 or later with the Given Name shown as <strong>“Living”</strong>.  Note that names of the parents will be seen allowing you to determine  if there is a possibility the family you have an interest in is present  in the indexed records. Note that FamilySearch uses a 100 year grace period where births after 1913 are not accessible on their site. </p>
