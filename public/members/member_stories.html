						The Remus family story starts with the Remus family involvement in the reformation and continues on later with their involvement in the Great Northern War in Poland which led to opportunities to settle in Poland circa 1730. The next major happening is when August Wilhelm Remus left Prussian Poland for Volhynia in 1866. There are pictures and stories from the 26 years the family lived in Volhynia. In 1892 they immigrated to Manitoba and Saskatchewan and homesteaded there. This document shows lots of pictures of most of the major villages in which they lived and the history that impacted the family.<br>

						The Hoffmann family left Saxony and settled in Prussian Poland around 1800. Suddenly in 1815 this area became part of Russian Poland. They then moved onward to Rawa and eventually arrived in Volhynia in 1833. They were cloth makers  so that craft and the farming needed to produce flax for cloth is discussed. About 1855 they moved the Romansdorf near Kiev, bought their land, and took up general farming. Sister colonies were set up nearby and they prospered. In 1892 things with the Russian government became very unpleasant and they migrated to the US and Canada.

						<li><a href="member_stories/Johann Hapke_English.pdf">An Autobiographical Composition by Johann Hapke</a> contributed by Karl Krueger.<br>
						Johann Hapke was a very devout man and highly respected by all. He apparently wanted to communicate with his children some important aspects of his life that apparently helped shape the man he became. After his death a long hand-written document was found where he recounts several key events of his life that detail these life-changing experiences. He starts this autobiographical treatise 1) describing his confirmation, 2) then explains how later he came to be a true Christian believer, 3) transitions to 1908 when he begins to serve in the Russian military, 4) recounts the death of his mother, 5) leading to the major and most suspenseful phase of this story as he is admitted to the military lazarette. Here the events surrounding his experiences will keep you on the edge of your seat as he becomes an unlikely and unwanted witness to a planned murder while laying rather helpless in bed. The murderers realizing that he knows their crime then plan to poison him to ensure keeping their crime a secret. After this suspense 6) the story calms down when he returns home to recover from his illness, briefly mentions his marriage, and 7) then leads to the final part of the story where he is again brought into the Russian military at the outset of World War I. Pictures affiliated with different aspects of his story are included to help bring the characters and events to life. <br>
