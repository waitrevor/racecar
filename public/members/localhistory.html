    <h2>About Community History Books</h2>
    <p>Many of the areas in  which our ancestors settled in Canada and the USA have produced history  books of the area, variously called Centennial books, Anniversary  books, Jubilee books etc. which describe or tell about the original  settlers in these areas.</p>
    <p>This page is where members  having copies of these books have offered to share this information  with other members by offering to lookup articles for other members if  a name in a book is of interest to another member.</p>
    <p><a href="#/members/AvailBooks.html">Books Currently Available</a></p>
    <p>See also this link to an outside group that has <a href="https://digitalcollections.ucalgary.ca/Browse/Collections/Local-Historie">many area histories in Canada</a>. First do a search by subject, and then when you find a book, do a search for any surname you seek.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Advanced Search Tips</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>+  after a number or letter will return all occurrences of records with  one or more of the characters preceding the +. Thus Cab+ finds Cab,  Cabby, and so on.</li>
      <li>* after a number or letter will return  all occurrences of records with zero or more of the characters  preceding the *. Thus ab* finds sad, cab, sabbath, and so on.</li>
      <li>?  after a number or letter indicates that the number or letter preceding  the ? is optional. Thus ou?r finds color, colour, and so on.</li>
      <li>.  (the period) puts any character or number in its place that is found in  the records searched. Thus n.t finds not, nit, nat, and so on.</li>
      <li>[^c]  finds any record that does not contain c (or whatever other character  is inserted after the ^ inside the brackets). Thus ar[^c] finds are,  art, but not arc. If you want to find all the names that begin with the  letter B, type ^B in the Name blank (case sensitve search only).</li>
      <li>[0-9] puts any digit in place of the bracketed item. Thus 1234[0-9] finds 12346, 12348, 12349, and so on</li>
      <li>^  finds all records that start with the letters following the ^. Thus  ^war finds war, ward, and wart, but not southward, eastward, forewarn  and so on.</li>
      <li>$ matches the end of the record field. Thus happy$ would find Edith Happy, but not happy birthday.</li>
      <li>() groups characters together. Thus (123) finds 123, 64123, 61234, etc.</li>
      <li>You can also use multiple special characters if you are brave enough. Thus (123)+ finds 123, 123123, and 123123123, and so on.</li>
    </ul>
