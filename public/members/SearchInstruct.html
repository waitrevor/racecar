    <h1 class="centered-content">Database Search Instructions</h1>
    <p>1. <strong>"Normal Search"</strong> is the default search. Because we use an  Oracle database engine, as you do a "Normal Search" you will quickly  find all occurrences of any given sequence of letters in a given search  field in the database. Thus, whether the sequence is a complete name or  only a portion of a name, no matter where you seek the sequence, it  will be found. For instance, if you type in "jaeger" (without the quote  marks), you will find entries that include, "Jaeger, "Lobenjaeger", and  "Geiger or Jaeger".</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. <strong>"Case Sensitive / Advanced Search"</strong> is an optional search, not necessarily available for all databases.  Such a search is the same as a Normal Search, EXCEPT you can also use  wildcards (see instructions below). For example the ? which can be used  as follows: Drae?ger will find Drager and Draeger all in one search.  Likewise, the * can be used as *rager to find both Drager and Grager in  the same search. Be creative in the data you use to search with, and  you will be rewarded accordingly.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. <strong>"Exact Match"</strong> will only find entries that include the exact letter sequence entered,  and will not return any entry with additional spaces or other  characters in the field searched.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. There are no umlauts  (dotted vowels) or other diacrtics in the database. Most of the  umlauted letters have been replaced with ae, oe, or ue, but there are  some names where the umlauted letter was changed to simply a, o, or u.  You need, therefore, to do a search for both spellings of the name  (ie., search for Konig as well as Koenig, etc.).</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. You do not need to enter data in all search boxes to find data. In fact, <strong><em>the more data you enter into the search fields, the fewer will be the results that will be returned</em></strong>, and it is likely that you will eliminate the data you seek if you narrow the search too much.</p>

    <h2><strong>Advanced Search Tips</strong></h2>
    <p>These apply only where <strong>"Case Sensitive"</strong> searches are available.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>+  after a number or letter will return all occurrences of records with  one or more of the characters preceding the +. Thus Cab+ finds Cab,  Cabby, and so on.</li>
      <li>* after a number or letter will return  all occurrences of records with zero or more of the characters  preceding the *. Thus ab* finds sad, cab, sabbath, and so on.</li>
      <li>?  after a number or letter indicates that the number or letter preceding  the ? is optional. Thus ou?r finds color, colour, and so on.</li>
      <li>.  (the period) puts any character or number in its place that is found in  the records searched. Thus n.t finds not, nit, nat, and so on.</li>
      <li>[^c]  finds any record that does not contain c (or whatever other character  is inserted after the ^ inside the brackets). Thus ar[^c] finds are,  art, but not arc. If you want to find all the names that begin with the  letter B, type ^B in the Name blank (case sensitve search only).</li>
      <li>[0-9] puts any digit in place of the bracketed item. Thus 1234[0-9] finds 12346, 12348, 12349, and so on</li>
      <li>^  finds all records that start with the letters following the ^. Thus  ^war finds war, ward, and wart, but not southward, eastward, forewarn  and so on.</li>
      <li>$ matches the end of the record field. Thus happy$ would find Edith Happy, but not happy birthday.</li>
      <li>() groups characters together. Thus (123) finds 123, 64123, 61234, etc.</li>
      <li>You can also use multiple special characters if you are brave enough. Thus (123)+ finds 123, 123123, and 123123123, and so on.</li>
    </ul>
