        <p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
        <p>1. You do not need to fill in every blank. You only need to type part of a name or word for the search engine to find results. Typing part of a word will return all of the derivatives; searching for the character “A” will return <em>any</em> word with the letter “A” in it.</p>
        <p>2. It can be difficult to find place names on some maps where the villages are densely spaced. It is easy if you use the "Find" feature of Adobe Reader. Open the map in Adobe, click "Edit", click "Find", type in the name of the village as it appears in the index without diacritics, and it will become highlighted on your screen. You may want to do this more than once in case that name appears more than once on the map.</p>
        <p><strong>A diacritical character is one which would not normally be found in the English alphabet</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Advanced Search Tips</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>+  after a number or letter will return all occurrences of records with  one or more of the characters preceding the +. Thus Cab+ finds Cab,  Cabby, and so on.</li>
          <li>* after a number or letter will return  all occurrences of records with zero or more of the characters  preceding the *. Thus ab* finds sad, cab, sabbath, and so on.</li>
          <li>?  after a number or letter indicates that the number or letter preceding  the ? is optional. Thus ou?r finds color, colour, and so on.</li>
          <li>.  (the period) puts any character or number in its place that is found in  the records searched. Thus n.t finds not, nit, nat, and so on.</li>
          <li>[^c]  finds any record that does not contain c (or whatever other character  is inserted after the ^ inside the brackets). Thus ar[^c] finds are,  art, but not arc. If you want to find all the names that begin with the  letter B, type ^B in the Name blank (case sensitve search only).</li>
          <li>[0-9] puts any digit in place of the bracketed item. Thus 1234[0-9] finds 12346, 12348, 12349, and so on</li>
          <li>^  finds all records that start with the letters following the ^. Thus  ^war finds war, ward, and wart, but not southward, eastward, forewarn  and so on.</li>
          <li>$ matches the end of the record field. Thus happy$ would find Edith Happy, but not happy birthday.</li>
          <li>() groups characters together. Thus (123) finds 123, 64123, 61234, etc.</li>
          <li>You can also use multiple special characters if you are brave enough. Thus (123)+ finds 123, 123123, and 123123123, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
