    <h2>Combine a surname with a date</h2>
    <p>Suppose  you do not know the first name of your male SCHMIDT ancestor but you  have good reason to believe he was born in 1868. Searching through the  hundreds of Schmidt listings would be very tedious. Instead, set the  search for “Case Sensitive / Advanced”. Enter “Schmidt” in the surnames  box. Enter “(1868)” in the birth date box. Enter “M” in the sex box. Do  not include any quote marks but do include the brackets around the  year. You will find a little more than a dozen to search through  instead of hundreds.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Combine a surname with sex</h2>
    <p>Find  all the males or females of a given surname by entering it in the  surname box and entering M or F in the sex box. This will work with a  “Normal Search”.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Combine a surname with a place</h2>
    <p>You  know your HEMMINGER ancestor lived in Friedrichsdorf (also known as  Solomka). Enter “Hemminger” in the surname box and “Friedrichsdorf” in  the birth place box and conduct a “Normal Search”. Repeat for the  marriage and death place boxes. Repeat again for Solomka. You may also  want to do a “Case Sensitive / Advanced” search using  “(Friedrichsdorf)”. This will ensure that you pick up ALL instances  where the original entry might read “Friedrichsdorf or Solomka” or  “Solomka or Friedrichsdorf”. Again, when entering the info, do not  include the quote marks but do include the brackets.</p>
