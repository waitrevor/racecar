  <h2><strong>Index of Individuals in Village Books for Galicia, Austria</strong></h2>
  <p>
    The files below are an index of Germans listed in various "Village Books" of Galicia, Austria from about 1788 to 1870 (the date varies with individual villages). "Village Books" are listings of inhabitants of a village during the period shown. The "Village Book" gives the name of the person and where known, spouse, parents and children and the Birth, Marriage, and Death dates and places, and the source of the information. The information is extracted from various sources such as parish records and census records.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the resident, their spouse, parents and children are all listed in the village book, the same names may appear in several of the books. For example, Johann may have been born in Kliendorf, moved to Dornfeld, his father lived in Hoenback, Johannâ€™s information will appear in the village books for all three locations. It is for this reason an individual may show up in two three or even more Village Books. The family information for this individual will be the same in each of the books.

  <p>
    The majority of these people were Lutheran/Evangelical although a number were of the Roman Catholic faith. The villages books that have been indexed to date are shown below.
