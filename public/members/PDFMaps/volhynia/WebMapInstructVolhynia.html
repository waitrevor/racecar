    <h2>ABOUT  THE  MAPS</h2>
    <p>The village names contained in this index come from a variety of sources.  All locations have been verified using historical and modern topographical maps.  These include, but are not necessarily limited to:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        - Ukraina Series (Zhitomir, Rowno, &amp; Wolhyn Oblasts) 1:200000 - modern maps<br>
        - Wojskowy Instytut Geograficzny, Mapa Polska  1:100000<br>
        - Heer Generalstass, Russland   1:100000  (German Truppenkarte - army maps)<br>
        - Austrian series untitled   1:200000<br>
        - Karte des Westlichen Russland   1:100000</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Previous maps have been created showing some of the German villages in Volhynia.  Those cited for reference include works by Karl Stumpp, Kurt Luck, Nikolaus Arndt, and Andreas Mergenthaler.  The last of these was discovered in the Captured German War Documents as microfilmed and held by the Library of Congress in Washington, DC.  Many additional villages were added by referring to a variety of lists such as:</p>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p>A special note is required to explain the villages reported in the last item, the St. Petersburg Consistory records.  To research these, I extracted just the village names from the online files.  This resulted in over 1200 pages of single line entries.  By eliminating duplications and those which I had already entered in my index, I was still left with over 50 pages of single line entries.  Many of these were place names that just made no sense.  They had obviously been misspelled either on the original record or by the extractor.  Researching thousands of entries by going back to original records would take many years and would still produce mixed results but I did make reasonable effort to find every single one.  Significant numbers were added to this index but many more remain unsolved.  My index is the most extensive resource of its kind, yet there are still villages that have not been found.</p>
    <p>The main wall map is drawn at 1:400,000 scale (1 cm = 4 km).  The density of villages in the regions of Lutzk (Luck) and Pulin is so great that detailed maps at 1:150,000 scale are provided.  The scaled location of roads, rivers, lakes, and other features is quite accurate. </p>
    <p>Many of the villages can still be found on the modern road map.  While they are shown with a dot, it should be noted that some of these are street style villages where the length of the village may be a kilometer or more.  Such villages can be so close together that it is impossible to determine where one ends and the other starts.  A particular example of this problem is Kapetultschin / Rissowata / Reichenau where it seems, though it is not proven, that the first two names represented separate villages while the third was a name applied to both as a combined village.</p>
    <p>While the village is shown quite precisely on the map, it can only be used as a guide if you ever intend to visit it.  Determining how to gain access to the village, sometimes over very rough trails, will require that you also find it on topographical and modern road maps.</p>
    <p>There are a few villages shown on the earlier reference maps which I could not find or verify on topographical maps.  These are shown in the approximate location referenced without a dot, in a smaller font, and in brackets in the form:      (Antonuwka)</p>
    <p>It is important to understand that this project can only report where we know that Germans lived.  If your ancestor lived at Katy, I can say with certainty that Germans lived at the Katy shown on the map.  I cannot guarantee that this is the Katy where your ancestor lived.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>PARISH  BOUNDARIES</h2>
    <p>The parish boundaries shown on the maps are approximate only and are based on those known to exist in 1909.  These boundaries should not be considered as absolute in determining where information about your family might be found.  Residents often crossed boundaries to receive the service of a pastor, especially for marriages.  These boundaries should be used for reference only. </p>
    <p>The time line for the creation of each parish is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Zhitomir - 1801 originally covers all of Volhynia<br>
        Rozyszcze - 1862 split from Zhitomir and covers all of western Volhynia<br>
        Heimtal - 1869 split from Zhitomir and covers northeast central area<br>
        Tuczyn - 1888 split from Zhitomir in the north central area<br>
        Nowograd Wolhynsk - 1889 split from Zhitomir in southeast central area<br>
        Wladimir Wolhynski - 1891 split from Rozyszcze on the west side 		Emilchin - 1896 split from Heimtal in to the north<br>
        Luck - 1899 split from Rozyszcze<br>
        Rowno - 1901 split from Tuczyn</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>GUIDE  TO  USING  THE  INDEX  AND  MAP</h2>
    <p>It is often impossible to establish an absolutely “correct” version of a village name.  Most names are written as pronounced and will vary based on Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, German, or English versions.  The index may show one or more alternate spellings but the map will only show one of them.  The one on the map is not necessarily more correct than the others.  This wide variety of options can make research very difficult. <br>
      Duplication of place names will cause grief for the researcher.  In the relatively small region of Volhynia, there are 16 Alexandrowka where Germans lived and many more exist.  Which of the 15 Antonowka, 10 Janowka, and other duplicate places did your ancestors live at?  The only way to know for sure is if you can find out some information about the location (is it on a river, near a city, etc.).   A parish name might help as a given parish might only contain one of those duplicates.</p>
    <p>Where variant spellings are very similar, the index will only show one listing  (Chmielnek / Chmielnow) and the first version will appear on the map.  Where there is significant difference, especially in alphabetical order, or where there is a Slavic and German version, two or more listings may be given but only one of them will appear on the map (Demidow Lasek / Neu Warschau will also appear alphabetically as Warschau (Neu) / Demidow Lasek - the map shows Demidow Lasek).</p>
    <p>In most cases, a two word place name, which contains an adjectival first word, is alphabetized by the root name.  Neu Warschau is in the index under Warschau (Neu).  If you cannot find your two word place in the version you have, try switching the words around. </p>
    <p>Certain pronunciation variations are common.  The following list may help you to determine the index spelling of your difficult place name.</p>
    <p><em><strong>H = G</strong></em> <br>
      This is the most common interchanged letter.  In Cyrillic script, there is no direct equivalent to the single letter H so it is often transliterated as G.  This applies to letters anywhere in the word.<br>
    Horodnica = Gorodnica	Kurhan = Kurgan</p>
    <p><em><strong>W = V</strong></em> <br>
    Wincentowka = Vincentovka</p>
    <p><em><strong>I = Y = J</strong></em> <br>
      Can have the English Y sound anywhere in the word.<br>
    Janowka pronounced Yanovka	Kobylyanka = Kobyljanka</p>
    <p><em><strong>I = Y</strong></em> <br>
      May be the long “ee” sound in the middle of a word.<br>
    Kobylyanka = Kobiljanka</p>
    <p><em><strong>Ch = H</strong></em> <br>
      Gutteral sound.<br>
    Chotisch = Hotisch</p>
    <p><em><strong>Ch = Kh</strong></em> <br>
      Hard sound.<br>
    Chopniow = Khopnev</p>
    <p><em><strong>Ch = Tsch</strong></em> <br>
      Has a soft T sound at the start of a word. <br>
    Chernobyl = Tschernobyl</p>
    <p><em><strong>c = tz</strong></em> <br>
      Middle or end of word.<br>
    Kremieniec = Kremienitz</p>
    <p><em><strong>cz = tsch or sch</strong></em> <br>
      Usually in the middle of a word.<br>
    Kloczki = Kloschki = Klotschki</p>
    <p><em><strong>G = K</strong></em> <br>
      At the beginning of the word.<br>
    Kluska = Gluschka</p>
    <p><em><strong>a = om</strong></em> <br>
      In some cases only, where the name is of Polish origin.  This only applies where the "a" originally had a diacritic hook under it.<br>
    Dabrowka = Dombrowka</p>
    <p><em><strong>vowels</strong></em> <br>
      Almost anything goes.<br>
      Dabrowka = Dubrowka<br>
    Emilowka = Amelowka</p>
    <p><strong><em>S = Z</em></strong> <br>
      Often at the beginning of a word but also in middle.<br>
    Salatuik = Zolotjuk</p>
    <p><em><strong>Sz = Sch</strong></em> <br>
    Szepel = Scheppel</p>
    <p><em><strong>szcze = schtshe</strong></em> <br>
      Other attempts are made at trying to reproduce the sound which results in a variety of letter combinations that could be used.<br>
    Rozyszcze = Rosischtsche = Roshishche, etc.</p>
    <p><em><strong>B = W</strong></em> <br>
    Not often but the character B in Cyrillic has the W / V sound.  On some maps, it appears that the cartographer neglected to transliterate this correctly.  Warwarowka could be misrepresented as Barbarowka or vice versa.</p>
    <p><em><strong>x = ks</strong></em> <br>
    Alexandrowka = Aleksandrowka</p>
    <p><em><strong>t = d</strong></em> <br>
    Podyka = Potyka</p>
    <p><strong><em>t = ł = l</em></strong> <br>
      Not a true equivalent but sometimes the Polish ł (L with slash through it) is transliterated incorrectly as a “t”. <br>
    Podyka = Potyka = Polyki</p>
    <p><em><strong>dsh = z</strong></em> <br>
    Podsharki = Pozarki</p>
    <p><em><strong>ow = owka</strong></em> <br>
    These are not really equivalent but I include it here to show that there are times when the “ka” is incorrectly either added to or dropped from a name.</p>
    <p><em><strong>ice = iec</strong></em><br>
    These are not really equivalent but are often transliterated incorrectly and therefore represent a common spelling variation.</p>
    <p>Neu = Nowe = Nowa = New</p>
    <p>Alt = Stare = Stara = Old</p>
    <p>Wolka = Wielke = Gross = Big</p>
    <p>Male = Maly = Klein = Small</p>
    <p>In summary, a creative imagination may help you find the place you are looking for. </p>
