      <h2>About the Maps</h2>
    </center>
    <p>Most of the  locations for Germanic settlements shown on these maps are all  extracted from, and based on, the previous work of Albert Breyer, Oskar  Kossmann, Kurt Luck and Wieslaw Sladkowski. These authors do not always  agree on which villages should be included nor on the exact location.  Combining this data into one source means that you can research all the  villages without having to find and research several different books,  maps and languages. </p>
    <p>It is quite possible that some villages of German residence  have been missed. Researching every microfilm of Lutheran parishes to  establish which those are is beyond the scope of this work. If you find  a village reference that is not included on these maps, then please  refer to the following list of map sources that may be of help.</p>
    <p>Most  maps are provided at a scale of 1:300,000 (if printed in the original  size of 7 inches wide by 9.75 inches high). In some areas, the density  of Germanic villages requires that a portion of the map be drawn at a  larger scale so that they can all be shown clearly. Or conversely, the  villages in northeastern Poland were scattered so far and wide that a  small scale map is most practical for the purpose. The scale for those  special maps will be shown on each map as required.</p>
    <p>In a  small percentage of cases, it has not been possible to accurately  locate certain villages. Such village names are shown on the map in  brackets in the form, (Nowe Wies).</p>
    <p>The objective of these  maps is to provide a reasonably accurate reference point for the  location of all the villages. If you intend to visit the village in  person, you will need to do further research using survey maps and road  atlases. I encourage the reader to use such maps to substantiate their  initial findings. Many good ones are available. Those used in my  research, in no particular order, included:</p>
    <blockquote> 1:300,000, Euro-Reiseatlas Polen, RV Verlag - Modern road atlas published in 1994.</blockquote>
    <blockquote> 1:200,000, Polska Atlas Drogowy, GeoCenter, Warsaw - Modern road atlas published in 1997.</blockquote>
    <blockquote> 1:200,000, "Austrian Series" - Historical map series published in 1930s  Vienna and believed to be based on pre World War I maps.</blockquote>
    <blockquote> 1:100,000, Wojskowy Institut Geograficzny, Warsaw - Historical maps from 1934.</blockquote>
    <blockquote> 1:100,000, German Army Series Historical from 1940 - Virtually identical to Wojskowy series but easier to read.</blockquote>
    <blockquote> 1:100,000, War and Navy Department Series, U.S. Army - Historical series from 1953.</blockquote>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>1:50,000, Army Map Service, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, Washington,  D.C., Series M751 - Historical series published in 1956 and based  extensively on previous Polish and German maps from 1927 - 1944. Just  because these are more detailed does not mean that they have more place  names. Places can be found on 1:300,000 scale that do not show on this  series.</p>

      <h2>Finding Your Village in the Index</h2>
    </center>
    <p>In  the index, I have attempted to enter as many variant spellings as  possible. However, to enter all the possibilities, especially in an  attempt to reproduce the many sounds implied by letters with  diacritics, would be impossible. The variety of possibilities in  switching between Polish, German, and English resources with their  variants and translations, seems insurmountable. I have tried to  provide enough variants to allow the village to be found in an  alphabetical listing. I estimate there are over 2800 entries covering  over 2400 locations. </p>
    <p>The index provides German, Latvian and other historical  variants where known. When you search the index, the report will show  what the place name looks like with diacritics if applicable. You can  also search the index using diacritics if you know them and if you can  type them with your computer. However, the maps only show the Polish  version of a place name <strong>without</strong> diacritics. Variants are separated by a slash. For example, if the index shows:</p>
    <blockquote> Schroettersdorf / Plock</blockquote>
    <blockquote> the map will only show: Plock</blockquote>
    <p>Because  the index is set up alphabetically for all variants, any time there is  a variant, you will get a report back with both versions. These are not  different places but simply duplicate listings. If you search for  "Plock", you will get a report back listing both:</p>
    <blockquote> Schroettersdorf / Plock</blockquote>
    <blockquote> Plock / Schroettersdorf</blockquote>
    <p>Some  listings in the index have a word that follows in brackets. This may  mean that one reference uses the word while another does not. Example:  Anielew (Kolonia)</p>
    <p>The brackets can also represent a word  applicable in another language. Example: Alt Kazimierka (Stare). Some  maps show the German Alt Kaimierka while others show the Polish Stare  Kazimierka. Both words translate to "old" in English.</p>
    <p>Because  of the diacritics used to pronounce Polish words, spelling variations  are frequent. If you have trouble finding a place, try switching some  of the letters, especially the vowels. If you think your place should  begin 'Dab...' and you can't find it, try 'Deb...' or 'Dob...'. If your  place name has two words in it, try switching them around to find them  in the index. For example, Karoliner Kaempe = Kepa Karolinska. If your  variant still isn't found, try listing all the places that start with  your known letter and browse through it manually.</p>
    <p>Here are some additional hints that may help you locate an elusive place name.<br wp="br1">
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>'OM', 'EM', 'EN' and similar sounds in Polish</em></strong>:</p>
    <p>Such sounds are often formed by Polish vowels with diacritical hooks under them. Examples:</p>
    <blockquote> You are looking for Gombin; Polish is Gabin with a hook under the 'a'</blockquote>
    <blockquote> You are looking for Dambrowka; Polish is Debrowka, hook under the 'e'</blockquote>
    <p><strong><em>The 'C' in a Polish name</em></strong>:</p>
    <p>This letter in Polish carries a t or tz sound and is a more common variant in surnames than in place names. Examples:</p>
    <blockquote> Martin in German = Marcin in Polish</blockquote>
    <blockquote> Hintz in German = Hinc in Polish</blockquote>
    <p><strong><em>The Polish letter combination SZCZ</em></strong>:</p>
    <p>This letter combination carries an 'st' sound. Example:</p>
    <blockquote> Szczecin in Polish = Stettin in German or English</blockquote>
    <p><strong><em>The Polish letter W</em></strong>:</p>
    <p>Always carries a 'v' sound.</p>
    <p><strong><em>The place NEUDORF or NOWE WIES</em></strong>:</p>
    <p>You  will be in trouble if that is all you know about an ancestor's place of  residence. It translates directly to "New Village" in English and there  are dozens of places with that name. You will need an associated parish  or province to help you pinpoint which is the correct one. If more than  one appears in a quadrant of a map page, you will find a listing for  each in this index.</p>
    <p><strong><em>The word DEUTSCH</em></strong>:</p>
    <p>This  word translates directly into "German" in English and "Niemieckie" in  Polish. If "Deutsch" appears somewhere in your place name, then  consider looking for "Niemieckie" in the Polish variant. In addition,  many places in Poland chose to eliminate any Germanic references to the  name so "Niemieckie" is replaced by "Nowe" (New). Examples:</p>
    <blockquote> Deutsch Mokre = Mokro Niemieckie</blockquote>
    <blockquote> Deutsch Troszyn = Nowe Troszyn</blockquote>
    <p><strong><em>X and KS</em></strong>:</p>
    <p>These are sometimes interchanged. Example:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Ksawerow and Feliksow might appear as Xawerow and Felixow</p>
    </blockquote>
