 <h1 class="centered-content">ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING</h1>
 <h2>Saturday, September 26, 2020, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada</h2>
    <p>Despite the pandemic, SGGEE will hold a modified in-person Annual General Meeting in 2020 in order to comply with the requirements of Canadian law. While all members have been  mailed an invitation, we are hopeful those within commuting distance of Calgary will make a special effort to attend the luncheon and AGM. </p>
	<p>For the many members who will not be able to attend, we have created an online proxy form, which will allow you to participate in the voting on the matters expected to come before the AGM. We hope hundreds of our members will take this opportunity by completing the form and submitting it by <strong>September 18, 2020.</strong></p>	
	<p>Proxy Form: <a href="https://f8s.co/24hm" target="_blank">https://f8s.co/24hm</a></p>	
	<p><strong>QUESTIONS MAY BE SENT TO <a href="mailto:&quot;directors-sggee@googlegroups.com&quot;">directors-sggee@googlegroups.com</a></strong></p>
