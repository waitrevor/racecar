    <p>These lists date from the 1930s and have been extracted from original Russian language KGB documents in the Zhitomir Archives. They include large amounts of data about the people, where they lived, names of family members, charges brought against them, results of charges, their execution date, etc. The repatriation documents are less detailed but still include valuabel clues. </p>
      <p>Due to the large amount of information provided, the type size has been reduced dramatically to make it fit on the PDF pages. Once you have the file open, use the "Enlarge" button in Adobe to make the text readable. You will have to scroll horizontally to see it all. The lists are alphabetical by surname. There are over 4100 persons in the KGB list, over 13000 in the repatriation list.<br>

      <h2 class="quick-jump" id="Felix Kuehn Index Cards"><a id="felix" name="felix"></a>Felix Kuehn Index Cards</h2>
      <p>In the 1980s, long before the Internet was available, Felix Kuehn traveled throughout southern Manitoba collecting data from families and churches related to the Friedensthal, Gretna, and Morden districts. He has graciously granted us permission to extract the information and make it available here. Special thanks to Carol Castleman for working on this project.</p>
      <p>Some comments are in order:<br>
      - The data is old. Locations of residence shown may no longer apply.<br>
      - Some data comes from family lore and may not be accurate. It was recorded as received.<br>
      - Some cards show only a name with no data. There is no point in requesting further information as all information shown on the card was extracted.</p>
      <p>In spite of these short comings, some records contain clues to people and places that you might not find elsewhere. They could be just what you need to further your research or add to existing information.</p>
      <p>How to use the data provided:<br>
        <strong>Step One</strong> - Open the "All Names" file for the community you want to look at. In the alphabetical list, find your person or surname of interest. to the right, will be a "Reference" name. Make note of it.<br>
      <strong>Step Two</strong> - Open the "Card Information" file for the corresponding community. In the alphabetical list to the left, find the "Reference" name. The next column to the right will have your original person of interest in it along with any applicable data.</p>

      <p>In fleeing the East during WW II, Pastor Lemke was able to bring with him a part of the Lutheran church books from the Zhitomir Parish in Volhynia. He eventually came to serve a parish in Edmonton and SGGEE was able to acquire a copy of these books. It includes birth information (almost 7000 records) for approximately the years 1921 to 1943 and marriage information (over 500 records) for 1941 to 1943.</p>
      <p>SGGEE volunteers have now indexed these records so that they are easier to research. Because many of the people in these books could still be alive, we have only indexed names and basic information. That is also why we are limiting this information to members only. If you find a person of interest in the index, you can request more info by sending an email to our <a href="mailto:databases-sggee@googlegroups.com">databases group</a> indicating the name and registry number of that person.</p>

      <p>Based on the route travelled by the Pastor.</p>
      <p>Can't find the location of an ancestral village with a common name in Volhynia?<br>
        <br>
        Many villages in Volhynia have the same name so how can you know which  is the right one? The results page of this search lists all the  registrations in sequential order as they appeared in the original  document. The pastors collected this information from the local Kantors  as they travelled their circuit. From this, one can deduce that the  order of villages on the page would be somewhat sequential as well. By  looking for a group of three or four villages, one can ascertain the  correct location for the village with the common name.<br>
