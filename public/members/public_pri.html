  <h2>Using the Search Tool</h2>
  <div class="paragraph-section">
    <p>
      We encourage you to review <a href="#/members/SearchInstruct.html">instructions</a> for using our search tool, especially if this is your first time. They will provide hints and tips for optimizing your search, thereby ensuring a better chance of getting results. We also suggest that you consider the following suggestions for names that may have been altered due to language variances.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      1. The records in this database are generally Polish records. As such, there are many Polish spellings of both surnames and given names. In order for you to find data, you may need to know the Polish equivalent of a German name (Gottlieb = Bogumil, Johann = Jan, etc.). Refer to our <a href="#/research/translation_aids.html">Translation Helps</a> page for further assistance with that. There are also some spellings which may have been anglicized by the extractor, such as Elizabeth and Edward, which are neither German nor Polish spellings. So you may need to try several different ways of spelling a name to find it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      2. Always use as few characters as possible in your search, as the sieve that nets the results may be too tight if you spell out names completely. For instance, always search for Elisabeth using only El in the given name field, as that will find Elisabeth, Elizabeth, Elzbieta, etc.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      3. Even though Polish and German names are often markedly different, you can sometimes be successful by typing in the part of the name that is the same in both languages. For instance, the given names Charlotte and Szlarlotta have similar parts, and a search for a given name that contains "lott" (without the " " marks) will return both versions of the name.
