    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>In  the interest of privacy, persons under the age of 80 who are living,  are not named but are listed as LIVING. However, if data is submitted  that does not include a birth date, the system cannot calculate how old  those persons are. The system considers them to be “dead” and the name  will show up in the search results. For submitters who do not want any  information about living people to appear, please include at least a  birth year in your submission to us. For more information, please refer  to our detailed <a href="#/about_us/privacy_policy.html">SGGEE privacy statement</a>.</p>
