                    Our first article is a translated document found in German archives following World War II which describes living conditions around Shitomir (Zhitomir) prior to the war. It was translated by Allen E. Konrad and is maintained at the Black Sea German Research website. The second article is a pair of letters submitted by SGGEE member Klara Bender that were written in 1929 and 1935 by relatives to describe their living conditions. The letters substantiate the Konrad translation. Also included are the 2024 financial reports compiled by Laurel Glanfield, our treasurer, and the 2024 annual reports.
