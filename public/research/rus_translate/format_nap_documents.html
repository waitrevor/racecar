    <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> The formats described here are what have been observed in the Lublin Parish (Lutheran) records. Although most records throughout Russian Poland will follow the same format, you may see slight variations when reading records from other cities.</p>
    <p> Each record starts with a statement declaring the place, date, and time when a particular event was recorded. With the records from the Trinity Lutheran Church in Lublin, it seems that since the 1860s all records were drafted in Lublin. With more recent documents we may find records that were composed in the daughter parishes of Kamien or Cycow. The date is normally shown as two days according to Julian / Gregorian calendars. Russians at that time used the Julian calendar where as Western Europe and North America used and continue to use the Gregorian calendar. In the 1800s there should be a 12 day differential and this changes to 13 days after February 28, 1900. The following formats are found for birth/christening, marriage, and death records: <br>
