        The core of the VKP database is the Volhynian portion of the St. Petersburg Archives records index extracted over 10 years ago by many volunteers (including many SGGEE members) and now  hosted in the original form on the <a href="http://www.odessa3.org">Odessa3 website</a>.  This portion of the original data on the Odessa3 index contains BMD data for Zhitomir, Rozyszcze, and Heimtal parishes for the years 1833 to 1885, with some years missing, approximately 72,000 line items.  For more information, see our <a href="#/research/parishes/church_parishes/LutheransInVolhyniaKievPodolia.html">Volhynia Parishes</a> page.

        <br>
        John Marsch says the following: "The usual disclaimers apply to this file of course. Check the SOURCE FILM is the watchword. . Radke made mistakes, I have made mistakes and the original recorder(s) made them as well. If considered necessary I (John) can check the Radke translations for members upon request. Surname spelling variations are the biggest bug-a-boo. In some cases there are three or four surname differences for an individual, some are radical."

        Parish Records Index (PRI) (last update  February 2012 - about 368,800 names in database)
          SGGEE has created a searchable database of names and other vital  statistics data from the indices of the original Polish and Russian  civil and parish records. See Job Central for a listing of the parishes  included. In some parishes the volunteers are  only extracting names from the indices, while in other cases the  volunteers are extracting all the data in the original record. Note  also that our database includes some personal files from a few of  our members, and that data contains some records from parishes that have  not been entered into the Job Central listing of parishes being worked  on.<br>
          <br>
          Permission has now been received from the Polish Archives to show <u>only the indices</u> for these records on the SGGEE website. An effort is being made to  convert those records that have more than just index information into  the Pedigree database, but until that is done, you can continue to ask  us to do a search of the master database to see if there is additional  information on any names that are of interest to you. Just send an  email to <a href="mailto:databases-sggee@googlegroups.com">databases-sggee@googlegroups.com</a> and be sure to mention that you want a specific search of the PRI  database for a specific name, including the registration number and  parish name.

Since it is sorted by film and page number, it is organized in the same way as the original parish records, and outlines the route taken by the pastor in collecting the information. The results page will show your village name in conjunction with others in the immediate area, thereby giving you a precise location. <b>NOTE that you can also use this database to find relatives in adjoining villages. </b>
