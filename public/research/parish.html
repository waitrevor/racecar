    <h2>Parish Names and Lists of Microfilms</h2>
    <p>LDS  microfilms for Polish regions are indexed according to provincial  boundaries as they were in modern Poland pre 1975. Since most of our  research covers the time before WW I, a summary of parishes in the  regions applicable to that time frame, with direct links to the  microfilm numbers, would be a major help to researchers. The following  links provide that for you.</p>
