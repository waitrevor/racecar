  <h2>Volhynia, Kiev and Podolia Lutheran Parishes</h2>
  <p>See the <a href="#/databases.html" target="_blank">Databases</a> page for explanatory information about the VKP database.</p>
  <p>This database is an index of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Marriages for the parishes of Zhitomir, Rozyszcze, Heimtal (all in Volhynia), Kiev, and Podolia for years 1833 to 1885, with some years missing, extracted from FHL microfilms of St. Petersburg Archive records.
      <p>Plus the following data extracted from online scans of register books held in AGAD and including the link to the online scan for each entry:</p>
    </li>
    <li>Marriages for Rozyszcze parish for the years 1862 to 1909 and 1919 to 1938 (1907 is missing).</li>
    <li>Marriages for Wladimir-Wolynsk parish for the years 1891 to 1899, 1907, 1915 to 1935.</li>
    <li>Marriages for Lutzk parish for the years 1899 to 1935.</li>
    <li>Marriages (based on records of banns; no marriage date and place) for 20 kantorates for varying years. Most of the kantorates are in the Rowno and Tutschin area.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> For the St. Petersburg Archive marriages only the names of the groom and bride and the date of marriage are given. However, the AGAD records are full marriage records containing the names and places of residence of the groom and bride, their ages and birthplaces, their parents’ names and/or name of previous spouse.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The spelling of names may vary due to many causes so it is desirable to check for possible variants when searching for a surname. For example, when searching for Buelau, one should also do a search for Buelow, Bilau, Bilow, Bylow, etc. Also, in some instances in the VKP databases, the surname is “corrected” to the more common spelling when a misleading spelling occurs in the church record.</p>
  <p>You can also search the <a href="#/research/StPeteBirth.html">Birth</a> and <a href="#/research/StPeteDeath.html">Death</a> databases.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Search Criteria</h2>
  <p>1. "Normal Search" is the default. It will find all occurrences of any given sequence of letters in a given search field. The sequence may be a complete name or a portion of a name. For example, if you type the sequence “haus” in the surname search box, you will find all entries with surnames that contain the sequence “haus” such as Hauser, Langhaus, Wachhauser, etc.</p>
  <p>2. "Exact Match" will only find entries that include the exact letter sequence entered, and will not return any entry with additional spaces or other characters in the field searched.</p>
  <p>3. There are no umlauts in the database (dotted vowels). Most of the umlauted letters have been replaced with ae, oe, or ue, but there are some names where the umlauted letter was changed to simply a, o, or u. You need, therefore, to do a search for both spellings of the name (i.e., search for Konig as well as Koenig, etc.).</p>
  <p>4. You do not need to enter data in all search boxes to find data. In fact, the more data you enter into the search fields, the fewer will be the results that will be returned. It is therefore possible that you will eliminate the data you seek if you narrow the search too much.</p>
