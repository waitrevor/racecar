    <p>HOW TO USE POLISH LUTHERAN RECORDS <br>
      FOR DOING RESEARCH IN CENTRAL POLAND</p>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>Lutheran  Parish records are organized by parish and year. They usually contain  separate entries for births, marriages and deaths and there is usually  a yearly index for each type of event. They are, almost without  exception, the records of people of German ancestry since people of  Polish ancestry are almost all of the Catholic or Jewish faith. The  records are generally in Polish before about 1868 and usually in  Russian after that date, although the records also sometimes contain  both Cyrillic and Roman alphabet surnames after that date. Even though  both the people that these records record, and the authors of the  records, spoke German, the language of the records usually reflects who  ruled this area of Central Poland. The records are almost always  handwritten.</p>
    <p>In order to find any meaningful data in  Central Poland, you as the researcher must have some idea of when and  where the person you are looking for was born, married or died. You can  establish relationships usually only by working backwards from what you  know. Therefore, unless there are exceptional circumstances (you  perhaps know the names of the parents of the person you seek), it is  not advisable to pick a name from a record that is the same as you are  looking for and then try to work downward toward yourself from there.  Careful and accurate research usually requires one of the following  records to start your research in Poland to make a connection further  back in time:</p>
    <p>1. A death certificate that lists the name  of the deceased, the date of death and the names and place of birth of  parents. (Be cautious of the data on a death certificate- the data  about parents is often incorrect)<br>
      2. A marriage certificate that  lists the place and date of the event, the bride and groom names, ages  and place of residence, and also names of parents of bride and groom.<br>
      3. A birth certificate that lists a person's name, date and place of birth and parents names.<br>
      4. A ship's record that lists the name and age of the traveller and his or her place of residence prior to emigration.<br>
      5. A family bible or other entries that list any of the above data</p>
    <p>One  final caution: Do not assume that, because someone has the same name  you are looking for, he or she is a relative. You can only be assured  that a person in a record is really your relative when the person has  the correct name, the correct year for the event, and the same parents.  For instance, you cannot jump from your birth certificate to the birth  certificate of one of your parents without knowing the names of your  grandparents. That data, unless you know it already, is usually only  available from one of the records listed above, usually a marriage  certificate.</p>

    <h2>Translating Polish Indices</h2>
    <p>As  soon as we get copyright release, we will be able to include on this  web site some of the indices of Polish Lutheran Parishes. Those indices  contain records of births, marriages and deaths, and many SGGEE members  are already collecting the data that we hope someday to be able to post  on our web site. </p>
    <p>As noted above, Polish records are  usually in Polish or Russian, and they are almost always handwritten.  That does not mean that you need to be able to be fluent in those  languages in order to translate the text. Since the indices contain  only the names and record number of the individuals recorded in the  actual birth, marriage or death record, you only need to be able to  read the letters in Polish (and German) handwriting before about 1868  (until we can post some Polish handwriting samples, go to the nearest  Family History Center to get a free guide), and the letters in Russian  (Cyrillic) after about 1868 (until we can post some Russian Handwriting  samples, go to the nearest Family History Center to get a free guide).  As with any language, when the penmanship is clear it is very easy, and  when it is not, it is difficult. As an incentive to translate the  Russian, you will find that it is usually clearer handwriting than the  Polish handwriting.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>What do I do when I find a name in an index?</h2>
    <p>Someday,  when enough SGGEE volunteers have finished our indexing task, you will  find index information for all of the Polish parishes that have been  filmed on our web site. Those indices will tell you which Family  History film to go to and find the actual record for the individuals  listed in the index.</p>
    <p>For now, however, you can send a  note or email to SGGEE and ask if we have data on a certain person in a  certain parish, and we may be able to direct you to the correct film  number by return mail or email. That film number is the number that you  need to use to order a film from the Family History Library in Salt  Lake City, Utah. Although that library is in Salt Lake City, and you  can view that film there for free, you can also order the film to and  review it at the Branch Family History Library nearest your place of  residence (at least in the U.S. and Canada). The Branch Family History  Library nearest you can be found by looking in your telephone book (or  by using the "Yellow Pages" in your web browser) for The Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Among the listings for that church  will usually be one for Family History Library. If no such listing  exists in your city, call one of the other numbers listed for The  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they should be able to  tell you where the nearest Branch Family History Library is located. Be  aware that more than half of the people that use both the Salt Lake  Family History Library and also the Branch Family History Libraries are  not members of that church. The cost for ordering each reel of film may  vary slightly by how far the Branch Family History Library is from Salt  Lake City, but it is only a few dollars for several weeks of use.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>What do I do when the film arrives for me to review?</h2>
    <p>You  will need to go to the Branch Family History Library to look at the  film. You will not be able to take the film home, but you can review it  at your leisure on one of their microfilm readers. Most Branch Family  History Libraries also have at least one reader that can be used to  make photocopies of individual records.</p>
    <p>In addition to  the samples of handwriting noted above, to translate the actual birth,  marriage or death record, you will need to know some Polish or Russian  words. You can find these word lists here: Polish word list (SOON) and  Russian word list (SOON). The translation is also simplified by the  fact that all of the records you wll find after about 1808 are recorded  in the Napoleonic format that was instituted by Napoleon and continued  even after his defeat. That code prescribes the order of the data  recorded and almost all of the words used in the record. See sample  Polish translation for example.</p>
    <p>As you translate the  record, pay attention to not only the names of the people for which the  record was recorded, but also the names of parents and witnesses.  Witnesses are often relatives and are a good way to determine that the  record is really your relative.</p>
