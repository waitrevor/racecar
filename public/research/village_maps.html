    <p><strong>Helpful Hint:</strong> Many maps on the Internet can be viewed at two levels. The first makes detailed review impossible due to the small size. The enlarged view is so detailed that navigating is difficult. Right click the small image and download it to your computer. Then use your favorite picture viewer to open the image and enlarge it to a convenient size. Some downloads can take a long time due to large file sizes.</p>
<p>Maps in the first section are on this site. All other maps are linked to other websites.<br>

    <p>1. <strong>SGGEE Location Guidelines and Gazetteers</strong><br>
    The  possibility of finding an ancestral village  on a map has many advantages and  enriches your family research. Members of  SGGEE have therefore created a guideline  for locations and have assembled six village gazetteersto help with the  search of villages of your ancestors  in Eastern   Europe. This will also serve to standardize the location  naming and thus make the merging of your data with the Master Pedigree Database  easier. We especially appreciate the efforts of Dr. Frank Stewner in Germany who was the primary contributor to this project. The gazetteers are copyrighted by Dr. Frank Stewner and are used by SGGEE with permission.</p>
    <p>The standards below will help you to find your village and understand the governmental districts and boundary changes that have taken place over the past two centuries. The gazetteers will  help you to find the villages and include actual map coordinates to take you to a precise location. They will also help you to correctly enter village locations in Legacy or other genealogy software.</p>

            <li><strong>Standards for the locations in family data</strong> for the Master Pedigree Database (MPD) - <a href="location_guidelines.pdf">Guideline</a>. We  simplified these Standards mainly concerning the name of the country. We are no longer mentioning the Empire to which the village belonged between 1815  and 1918/1945. Thus, for example, German Empire (Poland)  becomes Poland.  Since October  2013 we state more precisely the naming of Lithuanian villages that were  in Congress-Poland.</li>
            <li><strong>Appendix to the Standards for the locations in family data</strong> for the Master Pedigree Database (MPD) - <a href="location_guidelines_appendix.pdf">Appendix</a>. In the  appendix we describe how to find villages and we list the transcription tables  for the Russian and Ukraine Cyrillic letters.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> The <strong><u>simplification of the guideline</u></strong> means that we no longer name the Austrian-, German- or Russian Empires ruling between 1815  and 1918 or 1945 in East-Europe. That shortens the location name but does not  give any clue in which gazetteer a Polish location could be found. <strong>How can you   distinguish locations?</strong> When a Polish  location starts with a Polish name then it was in Congress-Poland and when it  starts with a German Name and a Polish name in brackets then it was in the  German Empire or in the Austrian Empire. Another clue is found in the names of  the Polish provinces: the Województwo Warmińsko-Mazurskie, Pomorskie,  Zachodniopomorskie, Lubuskie, Dolnośląskie, Opolskie, and Śląskie were in  Prussia (German Empire) and those of Małopolskie and Podkarpackie in Galicia  (Austrian Empire). The Województwo Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Wielkopolskie were  mainly in Prussia  but also in Congress-Poland. The Województwo Podlaskie was in Congress-Poland and Belorussia. In summary Polish  locations are difficult, not only because of the diacryts. For more details, please  consult the guideline</em></p>
    </ul>
          <p><strong>Gazetteers in general</strong>: all gazetteers can be downloaded as pdf files  which can be searched using the Adobe Reader "Find" feature.  The Gazetteers are  updated regularly. <strong>Present versions are  from August 2021. </strong></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>A note about latitude and longitude given in the gazetteers: These are given in degrees-minutes-seconds [ddmmss]. Because of the curvature of the earth, the distance of one second varies with the degree of latitude. At 50° it is approximately 30 metres or 100 feet. Therefore the location shown is very precise and  your actual village size will extend well beyond that specific location. To use these numbers in GOOGLE Earth, you will have to change the format to [dd mm ss N dd mm ss E].</p>

		  <p>We separated Eastern Europe into three Empires of 1900: Russian Empire, Austrian Empire and German Empire.</p>
		  <p>The government of Ukraine reduced the number of Rayons considerably on 18. July 2020. Therefore Gazetters of Volhynia, Ukraine and Galicia were changed.</p>
		  <p><strong>New:  We marked Mennonite villages in the first column with „m“ and created a new Gazetteer containing all Mennonite villages found in the various gazetteers: <a href="Gazetteer_Mennonite_villages.pdf" target="_blank">Mennonite villages in SGGEE Gazetteers</a>.</strong></p>

This Gazetteer is based on all villages seen on the maps by Jerry Frank (we include the map coordinates in the fourth column for all villages with German inhabitant at some time, not only those shown on the maps). We used many other sources including the villages named with “Kol.” on the polish maps of 1930, on the Hungarian-Austrian maps of 1900,  in the Gazetteer “Skorowidz miejscowości” by T. Bystrzycki from 1930 and started with a comprehensive 1906 Russian gazetteer which will take years to finish. <strong>In 2015 we made three important additions:</strong> first we separated the colony for the nearby village (thus you will see Toptscha and Toptscha Kol.), second we show all locations in Volhynia and third we included the addition Kol. whenever it was shown on any source. (7,453 locations, thereof 5,953 locations shown with Ukrainian name are existing today. In other words 1,490 locations were "lost".). <strong>New:</strong> Ukraine  started to change some village names which also affects the name of rayons  (counties). One example: Chervonoarmiisk changed to Pulin, the old name.</li>

A  separate column shows some of the village names used during the German  occupation 1939-1945 and another  column shows the villages as written in Poland with diacritics. The Gazetteer is mainly based on the Jerry Frank Index and  on many other sources. (6,394 villages)</li>

			<li><a href="Gazetteer_German_Empire.pdf" target="_blank">German Empire Gazetteer</a>. This  gazetteer contains villages east of Germany today. It is not comprehensive and contains  mainly villages found in the MPD. About  1935 many village names were “Germanized” in East-Prussia. We added the new  name after a slash.

  <p>1. A good set of <a href="http://maps.vlasenko.net/map-1k.html" target="_blank">maps covering all of Ukraine</a> is available on the Vlasenko site. Using  these maps requires that you contend with Cyrillic and that you know an  approximate region for the village. They are not indexed. Click on the grid for the region where you think your village is.  There is unfortunately no good way to guess exactly where that will be.  Experience with finding the village on older maps will help to pinpoint  the region.</p>
  <p>These maps do not have a convenient grid  system to identify the right maps to use so Dave Obee has graciously  provided us with one for both <a href="http://www.volhynia.com/topomaps.html" target="_blank">western and eastern Volhynia</a>.

  <p>1. <a href="http://english.mapywig.org/news.php" target="_blank">Archiwum Map Wojskowego Instytutu Geograficznego</a> is a site that is collecting and posting a variety of very detailed  topographic maps of Europe including Poland and Volhynia and ranging  from 1:25,000 scale to 1:300,000. There is no index so you have to know  the general location of your village before you can use them. The very  detailed scale makes them an excellent resource. The page is available  in English. The collection is continuing to add new material. While  there are gaps, go back regularly to see if they have been filled. </p>
  <p>For even easier searching, try the <a href="http://igrek.amzp.pl/mapindex.php" target="_blank">Mapster site</a> which indexes the above maps in a graphical interface that makes it very easy to use. The graphic map changes with the map series that you choose to use in the drop-down box. There is also a search function which will not find the average small village but will find your parishes. For example, a search for Gostynin will provide results for 18 different maps in a variety of scales, time frames and sources. A small box beside each result shows the relative location of that place on the map so you can find it easily.</p>
