    <h1 class="centered-content">German Migration to Brazil </h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>In 1935, the "Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Deutschen aus Russland und  Polen" (Working Group for Germans from Russia and Poland), working in  conjunction with the German government, began to facilitate the  emigration to Brazil of Germans who had been refugees from Russia.  Those who met the requirements were given free transportation to Sao  Paolo, were expected to work as agricultural day-laborers for one year,  and were then, upon payment of an installment, assigned a permanent  place to live by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft. The correspondence between  the Arbeitsgemeinschaft and the applicants for emigration eventually  found its way into the files of the Deutsches Ausland-Institut, and  from there, by virtue of having been captured by the Allies in 1945,  into the U.S. National Archives, where a small portion of it was  microfilmed.</p>
    <p>This small portion can be found on Rolls 353  and 354 of Series T-81 of the "Records of the Deutsches  Ausland-Institut, Stuttgart. Part II: The General Records". It contains  the correspondence of over 100 families (mostly living in Prussia) with  the Arbeitsgemeinschaft, dealing with various details of the selection  process, transportation, financial considerations, etc. Also included  are minimal amounts of genealogical information (usually of the  immediate family only). In some cases there are only one or two  letters; in others, the correspondence was quite extensive. In  addition, about 35 people are mentioned in letters between  Arbeitsgemeinschaft officials. These names are given in the list below.  Far more than these names could have been listed if the decision had  not been made to microfilm only the files A through E "as a sample".  And to make matters worse, the files F through Z are apparently not to  be found in either the National Archives of the U.S. nor the  Bundesarchiv in Koblenz, Germany. Hopefully, they have not been  discarded entirely, and will be found some day. But for those few  families listed here, these letters may well provide interesting  information about a significant moment in their family history.</p>
    <p>Roll  353 contains the files, A through C, while Roll 354 has the files D and  E, along with the inter-office correspondence referred to above. <strong>[We  are still looking for files F to Z. Note that even though most of the  names in the list below begin with the letters A to E, there are still  many names that begin with other letters that are mentioned in the  files that contains the person whose name begins with the letters A to  E] </strong>Both rolls are available at the headquarters of the Germans  from Russia Historical Society in Bismarck, or may be seen at, or  ordered from, the U.S. National Archives (www.nara.gov).</p>
    <p>___________________________________________________</p>
    <p>CONTENTS OF ROLLS 353 AND 354, SERIES T-81, OF THE RECORDS OF THE DEUTSCHES AUSLAND-INSTITUT</p>
    <p>Film  353 contains the contents of DAI Folders 78, 79 and 80. Frame numbers  extend from 5082517 to 5083907. Film 354 contains the contents of DAI  Folder 81, plus other material of no relevance to Germans from Russia.  Frame numbers of relevant material from 5083908 to 5084496.</p>
    <p>Folder  78 (frames 5082517-5082734) contains mostly correspondence related to  German minority affairs in Switzerland, South Africa, Southwest Africa,  Spain, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia (S through T in German  alphabetization). The time period is mostly the early to mid-1920s.</p>
    <p>Folder  79 (frames 5082735-5083001) contains mostly correspondence from the  1920s related to German minority affairs in Hungary, Uruguay, the  United States, and Venezuela (U through Z). It actually begins with a  few letters concerning South Africa and Sweden, and then a file of  letters relating to Germans in Nova Scotia, Canada (a few of whom were  Nazi sympathizers) in the 1930s. The largest file is that of the United  States, in which many letters pertain to efforts to bring German  immigrants to the United States and to the Lutheran Church in the  United States.</p>
    <p>Folder 80 (frames 5083002-50839097) should  be of great interest for families of Germans from Russia who emigrated  during the 1930s to Brazil. This folder contains letters of these  families to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Deutschen aus Russland und  Polen (Association of Germans from Russia and Poland) in which they  applied for that organization’s help in emigrating to Brazil. There was  often an exchange of letters, sometimes extending over a considerable  period of time, dealing with various problems involved in the  application and emigration process. There was almost always a minimal  amount of genealogical information given, and in many cases (marked  with an asterisk*), a formal questionnaire was filled out with family  information. Folder 80 contains correspondence with families whose name  began with the letters A, B, and C. They are roughly in alphabetical  order, but one must look through the entire list given below to be sure  a name is or is not listed. The list below represents the family names  in the order they appear on the microfilm. A few names recur after an  interval, and these are marked with a plus sign+.</p>
    <p>Folder  81, which was incorporated into Roll 354, covers the letters D and E,  but with the addition of correspondence which mentions names beginning  with letters ranging randomly from D to S. Unfortunately, the  microfilming project in the 1950s filmed only these two folders “as a  sample” (according to the National Archive’s “Guides to German Records  Microfilmed at Alexandria, Va.”, no. 21, p. 8). The Folders which  followed Folder 81 and contained files from F to Z have not been found,  either in the U.S. National Archives nor in the Bundesarchiv in  Koblenz, Germany.</p>
