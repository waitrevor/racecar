     <h4><a id="samplePol" name="samplePol"></a>Workshop Handouts for Translation of Polish and Cyrillic Handwritten Records </h4>
        <p>Sigrid Pohl-Perry has conducted translation workshops at several annual meetings. The handouts she uses here provide examples of how to better recognize the format of the various records in both languages, indicates translation of key terms on the records, and gives translation lists of important words such as dates and numbers. The following two sections on this page are additional resources to help you work on your translation skills. </p>

        <h4><a id="sampleRus" name="sampleRus"></a>Sample translations of Russian Language Church Records</h4>
      <p>SGGEE has created its own set of help files for translating the Napoleonic style of Russian language records. <a href="#/research/rus_translate/general_intro.html">These pages</a> include translation forms for numbers, months, and places.  They also include samples of records from the Lublin Lutheran Parish.<br>
      </p><p>Although we believe the above to be most helpful, Jack Bowman (see note in Polish section above) also created some samples of Russian translations and we offer them here for you - <a href="rus_translate/Images/Birth Record_Bowman.pdf">Births</a> - <a href="rus_translate/Images/Marriage%20Record_Bowman.pdf">Marriages</a> - <a href="rus_translate/Images/Death%20Record_Bowman.pdf">Deaths</a>. <br>

It does mean that the names listed there have not been substantiated by someone using more than just personal family records or family lore.

    <p><i><b>Note</b>:  Some of the sites listed below, such as Babelfish, will allow you to insert the link for a web page and it will then translate the entire page for you.  But a word of <b>caution</b>. Electronic translations devices are far from perfect, which can lead to some odd translations as well as significant errors. For example, it does not know if a word is a name or not. So a phrase like "Herr Steinwand" (Mr. Steinwand) might be rendered as "mister stony wall". Similarly, the electronic translator can only make a best guess as to which of several alternate meanings is required. If the material is really important to your research, use a qualified human translator.</i></p>
