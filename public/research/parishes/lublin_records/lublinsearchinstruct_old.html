    <h2><strong>General Information</strong></h2>
    <p>To  learn more about how the Lublin Research Team project evolved and how  it cooperated with the Lublin Trinity Evangelical Church, please visit  our <a href="#/members/lublin_records/English/lublin_team_history.html">Lublin Research History</a> page.</p>
    <p>BEFORE  USING THE LUBLIN SEARCH UTILITY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ AND UNDERSTAND  THESE INSTRUCTIONS. You may want to print them out to have at hand  while doing the searches. Note that many of the reference links  referred to in this discussion are at the top of this page for your  convenience as you become familiar with the use of this search utility.</p>
    <p><span>&lt;This  page is used to search for records found in the Lublin Trinity  Evangelical Church Digital Archive.&nbsp; After searching the database,  <span>records of interest can be requested from the church by providing the  output obtained from this search utility. Details about how to request  these records and how payment can be made are found at the <a href="#/members/lublin_records/English/TrinityRecordRequest.html">Lublin Church request / donation page</a>.</span>&gt; </span><span>As of June 2013 no response has ever been received when trying to contact the church. It may not be possible to obtain these records unless you visit the church personally or the Family History Library finally releases their digitized copies. </span></p>
    <p>The  searchable database, when completed, will point to most documents in  the Lublin Digital Archive. These are primarily birth / baptism  records, death records, and marriage records. Occasionally other  accompanying documents associated with people found in the former  records are included and these documents are accessible as well. The  records extend from 1838 to 1959 (years 1840-1845 are lacking),  although virtually all Germans left this region in 1940 through the  action of <a href="http://www.volhynia.com/res-ewz.html">Einwandererzentralstelle</a>.</p>
    <p>Records  are either in German, Polish, or Russian. Disks 1-20 are of the  Napoleonic format (1838-1889) and are written in either Polish or  Russian. Most records on disks 21-71 are in German but many Polish or  Russian documents are found as well. Additional Napoleonic records may  also be found such as those from the Konskowola parish. A more in depth  discussion of the records encountered in this archive can be found on  the <a href="#/members/lublin_records/English/record_types.html">Examples of Record Types</a> page.</p>
    <p>Currently  this represents a developing project. A description of what is found in  different disks / folders including colour coding for the progress of  indexing is found in the <a href="disk_descriptions.pdf">Lublin Disk Descriptions</a> file. A listing of disks included in the database and the running tally of numbers are provided on the <a href="data_inclusion.pdf">Data Inclusion Summary</a>.&nbsp;  As more data is added to the database these files will continue to be  updated. We hope to add additional data into the database every four  to five months. Due to the extensive number and diversity of records, it will  take a number of years to complete this indexing project so we ask your  patience.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Nature of the Data</strong></h2>
    <p>Specific data elements have been used to construct this database. These data elements and their descriptions include:</p>
    <p>1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Name (P) (as spelled in Polish or translated from Russian by the transcriber)</p>
    <p>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Name (P)&nbsp;&nbsp; (same as 1 above)</p>
    <p>3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Name (D) (a typical German spelling is given here)</p>
    <p>4-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Name (D)&nbsp; (same as  3 above)</p>
    <p>5-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event Type (B=birth/christening, D=death, M=marriage, X=other)</p>
    <p>6-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Month (Gregorian calendar month that <strong>the record was written or event occurred</strong>)</p>
    <p>7-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Year (Gregorian calendar year that <strong>the record was written or event occurred</strong>)</p>
    <p>8-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father  (Given name of the father - German equivalent only)</p>
    <p>9-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother or Bride (P) (as described for Polish names in 1 above)</p>
    <p>10-&nbsp; Mother or Bride (D) (German equivalent as described in 3 above)</p>
    <p>11-&nbsp; Village (where the family or husband resided or where the death occurred)</p>
    <p>12-&nbsp; Disk (can be from 1 – 71)</p>
    <p>13-&nbsp; Folder (folder on the disk in which the record is found)</p>
    <p>14-&nbsp; File (file identifier for this record)</p>
    <p>15-&nbsp; Reg. # (Register number for the record. Many files have multiple records)</p>
    <p>16-&nbsp; Groom’s Parents (names are the German equivalents)</p>
    <p>17-&nbsp; Bride’s Parents (names are the German equivalents)</p>
    <p>18-  Spouse(s)  (names are the German equivalents)</p>
    <p>19-&nbsp; Special Notes (optional remarks pertinent to the information on the record)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Other Tips and Comments</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Searching Event Type</strong><br>
      The search utility varies depending on the Event Type that you are  searching for. Only data elements relevant to a search for that Event  Type are available to search. For example, you cannot search for  Bride’s Parents on death records as there is no bride on a death  record. Documents that are of the “Other” Event Type are searched only  as births. Last and given names are included on those documents.</p>
    <p><strong>Searching By Year(s)</strong><br>
      Years can be searched by including a single year.</p>
    <p><strong>Villages</strong><br>
      Villages from the Lubelskie province have been given standardized spellings. Please check the <a href="lublin_villages_list.pdf">Lubelskie Village List</a> to know how a village should be entered into this optional search box.  Some records include locations outside of the Lubelskie province (such  as death records from the World War I deportation period) where  spellings have not been standardized.<br>
  <br>
      The parish in  Kamien was started in 1876 at which time people living in the more  eastern and southern sectors of the Lubelskie province tended to report  here (see the <a href="lubelskie_region_map.pdf">Lublin and Kamien Parish Boundaries Map</a>).  The records in this archive show a noticeable under-representation from  these villages. The Napoleonic records of Disks 1-20 show this  transition starting after 1875 where only towns represented within the  Lublin boundaries are retained (except for occasional marriage records  where the families went to Lublin rather than Kamien). It is hoped that  greater coverage of the Kamien sector will be found as more disks from  21-71 get completed.</p>
    <p><strong>Searching by Name</strong><br>
      When  searching for Names the complete name need not be given. This allows  for greater flexibility in finding pertinent records that might not  have an exact spelling. Although the use of “Polish” and “German  equivalent” names may seem redundant, this was necessary to in effect  standardize how names should be written (in German) as many pastors or  kantors over 100 years often had their own convention of spelling  names.&nbsp; Having both versions of the names spelled out also helps the  church staff verify that they have found the correct record with the  expected people listed.&nbsp; Names that are of Polish or Russian/Ukrainian  origin generally were kept as written.</p>
    <p><strong>Stillborn Cases<br>
    </strong>Babies  that were stillborn or died shortly after birth (and not given a name)  are found in either birth or death records. For consistency in this  database all such cases are indexed as deaths with the given name  “stillborn {male/female}”.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Entries Containing Question Marks or Brackets</strong><br>
      Some search results include names of people or towns with embedded  question marks. This is because these handwritten records can be  difficult to accurately interpret if the transcriber had sloppy  penmanship.&nbsp; Particularly for records in Cyrillic it can be difficult  to distinguish among several possible letters or combinations of  letters.<br>
  <br>
      Other entries may have brackets [ ] surrounding a name. This  corresponds to information that was not included on the record but this  information could be deduced from other records.</p>
    <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>
      As a final note, to protect the confidentiality of those likely to  still be alive, identities of people who were born after 1920 will not  be revealed unless an accompanying death record was also found. A  search for birth records will reveal any potentially living person born  in 1920 or later with the Given Name shown as <strong>“Living”</strong>.  Note that names of the parents will be seen allowing you to determine  if there is a possibility the family you have an interest in is present  in the indexed records. Requests for additional information regarding  people potentially still alive (born after 1920) must be made through  the   									  										Lublin   									  								  									church.</p>
