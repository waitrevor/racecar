    <p>In June 2013 the pastor of this church who oversaw and promoted the digital archiving of their records  moved to Warsaw. Since that time all attempts to contact the church have gone unanswered. Please do not try order records or send payment to them until further notice. Until that time it may not be possible to obtain these records unless you visit the church personally or the Family History Library finally releases their digitized copies. </p>

    <h2>Requesting Records</h2>
    <p>Records found in this digital archive can be requested from the church in Lublin. It is best to email the church at <a href="mailto:luteranie.lublin@gmail.com">luteranie.lublin@gmail.com</a><a href="mailto:lublin@luteranie.pl"></a> for these requests. It would be most convenient to copy the entire row  corresponding to a single record from the results output of a search  you have made. That information should be sufficient for the church  staff to know which record(s) you are interested in. Note that the data  elements Disk, Folder, File, and Reg, # provide the information where  they can locate your records of interest.&nbsp; The names associated with  the record provide the confirmation that you have specified the correct  record.</p>
    <p>The church staff or pastor can only understand  Polish or German. Any email messages directed to them should be in  either of these languages. Generally, the information from the results  output should be sufficient for them to understand that you are  requesting the indicated records. If you would like birth/baptismal  records from anyone potentially still living then please indicate this  in your email message and specify the disk and folder where you expect  the record to be. Note that the search engine will allow visibility to  records of those who may still be living, yet not disclose their  identities. You can copy and paste the lines below in <span>red</span> &nbsp;(Polish) or <span>blue</span>  (German) for use in your email. Translation of these sentences are  followed in italics. Other examples of text you may wish to use follow  this important one.</p>

    <h2><strong>Donations</strong></h2>
    <p>The church as of March 2012 has hired two assistants to help with retrieval of records from the digital archive. To pay for their services they are asking that 20 Euros be sent for each record requested. We hope to dialogue with Pastor Chwastek on these recent changes to possibly develop a sliding scale for payment when someone orders multiple records at once. We realize at this rate the cost of many records can become exhorbitant.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The church has three mechanisms by which  they can receive donations:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;1 –  Credit Card (online payments can be made via their website - <a href="http://www.lublin.luteranie.pl/en.index1.php">http://www.lublin.luteranie.pl/en.index1.php</a> )<br>
<br>
2 –  PayPal (specify their email address as <a href="mailto:luteranie.lublin@gmail.com">luteranie.lublin@gmail.com</a> )<br>
<br>
3 – A direct transfer to the bank account of the Church <strong>between EURO countries</strong> using an EU wire transfer costs as much as a domestic money transfer. Bank transfers from  <strong>non EURO countries</strong> are associated with increased costs and therefore recommended only for larger amounts. The information below is required.</p>
