    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Germans  started to settle in the villages of Sadoles and Platkownica (and three  others) around 1830. The land on the south side of the Bug River (south  of Brok) was owned by Count Andreas Zamojski. This region was served by  the Pastor from the Wengrow Parish. After the original Sadoles church  burned down, a new one was constructed in 1906. Soon after, a new  larger one was constructed at Platkownica and dedicated in 1908. The  farmer, Jacob Müller, was largely responsible for its construction.  Later, the Diocese of Warsaw constructed a Deaconet House named  "Tabita" as a respite home for the Sisters (deaconesses). The parish  was given independent status in 1906 but never had its own pastor until  1939, always having been serverd from either Wengrow or Warsaw.</p>
