    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Germans  first settled in this region at the villages of Łyszkowice and Zawady  around 1800.&nbsp; A leased hall in Lowicz served as a church but most of  the colonists in the rural villages were served by teachers and  Kantors.&nbsp; At first Łowicz was served by pastors travelling from  Wiskitki but this proved unsatisfactory due to the large numbers  there.&nbsp; So, in 1836, Pastor Gustav Schwarz moved from Wiskitki to  Łowicz and it became the new parish center.&nbsp; Wiskitki became the  Affiliate, served by the pastor from Łowicz.</p>
    <p>With the  help of funds provided by the Warsaw Consistory and by Czar Nicholas I,  construction of a church was begun in 1838 and finished in 1840.&nbsp; A  parsonage was completed in 1855.&nbsp; Attendance here peaked in 1864 after  which it began to decline.&nbsp; The emigration of Germans to Volhynia  1866-1880 was especially devastating.&nbsp; In 12 original settlements,  there were no longer any Germans and in others, only a few remained.</p>
