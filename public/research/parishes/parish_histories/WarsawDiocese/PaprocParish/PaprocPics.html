          <td colspan="2"><span>Originally  a Lutheran Church built in 1841, a local resident recently advised,  "After WW II, cows were kept in the church. Then the roof fell in. Then  it was rebuilt and the design kept intact with a little space added on  the rear (as can be seen in the photo)." It is now used by the  Catholics. Comparison to an old photo confirms that the rebuild is  quite faithful to the original design. <br>
