    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Around  1800, colonists from Mecklenburg founded the settlements of  Konigshuld/Paproc Duza (Gross Paprotsch), Luisenau, Wilhelmsdorf  (Krole) and Mecklenburg (Kowalowka). <br>
        <br>
      Prior to the  establishment of the church with a full time pastor, it was served by  pastors from Chmielowka-Suwalki and from Wengrow. Until a proper  parsonage was constructed in 1856, some of the pastors lived in Lomza  and served the parish from there. Most of the village was destroyed in  World War I with only the church, parsonage, and three other homes  being saved. Actions of the German occupation during World War II  resulted in the parish being relocated to Mława and Neidenburg,   								  									East Prussia  								  							  							  								  									.  After the war, many of these Germans were relocated to   								  							  							  								Mecklenburg   							  and Schleswig-Holstein. During its existence, the parish produced five  pastors who served the Augsburgian Lutherans: Rudolf Gustav Gundlach,  Johann Buse, Rudolf Buse, Julius David Buse and Adolf Krempin.</p>
