    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>During  the South Prussian times Lutheran German farmers and craftsmen settled  around Kutno.&nbsp; They originally had a small wooden church in the village  of Krośniewice. Later on this center shifted to Kutno, probably because  of better economic conditions due to the large sugar factories in  Kostancja, Zychlin and Ostrowy. In the year 1797 Kutno became an  Affiliate.&nbsp; In the Year 1879 they started to build a church that was  dedicated on the 10th of November 1880. By&nbsp; 1867 there were four  schools in the Affiliate.</p>
    <p>The administration of Kutno was  mostly done from Łowicz, apart from 1841—1857 when it is was covered by  the pastor of Gostynin.&nbsp; [Editor's note:&nbsp; The early administration of  Kutno as an Affiliate could not have been done from Łowicz as it was  not founded until 1836.&nbsp; It may have been served from the distant Ilow  Parish but that is not indicated in the source material.]&nbsp; The former  German Sejm deputy Jakob Karau was Teacher and Kantor.&nbsp; He died 3rd  August 1938.</p>
