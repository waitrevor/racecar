    <p>Note: <em>The term "ewangelic" translates to "evangelical" in English but in German context, especially in materials written by Kneifel, a Lutheran pastor, it should be thought of as reference to followers of Martin Luther. There was no church in Europe named as the Lutheran church, as is the case in North America. In other contexts you will find "ewangelische-Reformierte", the Reformed Church, "ewanglische-Unierte", the United Church and perhaps others. Other denominations such as Baptists (Baptisten) or Mennonites (Mennoniten) did not, for some reason, get the "ewangelic" descriptor.</em></p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Located about 85 km north of Warsaw.</li>
      <li>In 1814 German Lutheran Colonists settled in  Janowka, County of Ciechanow.</li>
      <li>In about 1820 Kicin, Grabowiec, Lipowiec,  Rzeszotko, Wola Wodzynska, Halinin and Trzpiał were added to Janowka.</li>
      <li>The Masurian Lutheran villages of Helenowo,  Jozefowo, Dąbrowa, etc. were added as well.</li>
      <li>Many farmers immigrated to the Lublin region and to  Russia from Kanigowka, Wojtkowa, and other settlements.</li>
      <li>Around 1860 the colonies flourished briefly, but the  uprising of 1863-64 not only interrupted their growth but led to larger emigration  to Volhynia and after 1890 to America.</li>
      <li>Plans existed as early as 1823 for the founding of  a parish in Przasnysz, but the 300 Lutheran families were not prepared to pay  600 zloty annually for the support of a pastor; they rather sought help and support  from the government.</li>
      <li>In 1823 the government gave a plot of land and the  necessary material for the building of a church and a parsonage for a cost of  6,975 zloty.</li>
      <li>Pastor Lauber of Warsaw dedicated the new church  on May 18, 1826.</li>
      <li>The parsonage proved to be too small, and thus was  converted to a school and an apartment for church personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; A larger parsonage was completed in 1862.</li>
      <li>The government began to provide to the parish in  1835 an annual stipend of 1,500 zloty.</li>
      <li>Vikar Emil Lauber was selected in 1835 as the  resident pastor in Przasnysz.</li>
      <li>Lauber’s work  was strongly opposed from the outset by a considerable number of the members;  this opposition continued until an affiliate was formed in Lipiny, County of  Ciechanow.</li>
      <li>Conflict between pastor and congregation ensued,  forcing Lauber to leave the parish for a lengthy period and reside in a rented  residence in another town.&nbsp; He hurried  through services and failed to perform his religious duties such as burials,  which had to be postponed for up to three weeks.&nbsp; The consistory removed Lauber from Przasnysz  when members began to leave the church and join the Catholic parish.</li>
      <li>During the service of Kasimir Lembkes (1858 –  1872) and pastors Karl Doll and Julius Kweiszer, the Baptist movement  spread.&nbsp; Kweiszer was helpless in  opposing the work of the Baptists and was moved to Wizajny by the  consistory.&nbsp; His successor, Ferdinand  Robert Haefke, also was ineffective and left the area.</li>
      <li>The pastor position in Przasnysz was vacant from  1881 to 1898, and the parish lacked leadership and spiritual care.</li>
      <li>Under the short assignments of Robert Gundlach and  Oskar Ernst, improvement was slow and the lack of cooperation between them and  the church leadership exacerbated the bad situation .</li>
      <li>Pastor Ernst dedicated the addition of a sacristy  and a tower to the church on November 27, 1903.</li>
      <li>Almost all members were forcibly moved to the  interior of Russia during World War I.<br>
