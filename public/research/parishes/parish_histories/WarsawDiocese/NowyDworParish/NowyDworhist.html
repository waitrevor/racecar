    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The  Nowy Dwór region is one of the older settlement areas in Russian  Poland.&nbsp; A Mennonite village, Deutsch-Kazuń,was founded in 1776 across  from the Modlin fortress.&nbsp; In 1782, the archbishop was granted a  charter to establish the town of Nowy Dwór on his estate and many  Lutheran German craftsmen began to arrive there in the following years  1783-1790.&nbsp; In the Prussia era 1793-1806, 13 skippers and 2  shipbuilders also arrived from Berlin and Stargard.</p>
    <p>The  Evangelical (Lutheran) settlers were granted freedom to practice their  religion by Archbishop Stanislaw Poniatowski so in 1782 they  established the parish of Nowy Dwór.&nbsp; At first the parishioners met in  private houses for prayer.&nbsp; In 1806 they were granted permission to use  the upper floor of the town hall as their chapel.&nbsp; In 1818, Graf  Gutakowski donated a house to the church which was used as a  parsonage.&nbsp; Finally, in 1826, the government granted them full use of  the town hall which was then converted into a church.&nbsp; This was again  renovated in 1867 and enlarged in 1906.&nbsp; Disaster struck in 1907 when a  huge fire destroyed 120 homes in Nowy Dwór.&nbsp; A graveyard chapel in  Neuhof was dedicated in 1937.</p>
