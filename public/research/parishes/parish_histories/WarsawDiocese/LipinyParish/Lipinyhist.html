    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pomeranian  Germans first arrived in this area in 1820 and founded the village of  Lipiny.&nbsp; The area was first served with pastoral care from Przasnysz  but this proved difficult due to the 20 km distance from the church.&nbsp;  Tensions arose with a reluctance to pay the church tithe and with the  need for baptisms and marriages to be performed by local Roman Catholic  priests.&nbsp; Because of this, the Warsaw Consistory ordered the  establishment of Lipiny as an Affiliate in 1837.</p>
    <p>The  Germans in Lipiny wanted a church but had to compete with Wola Młocka  where most of the parishioners lived.&nbsp; Wola Młocka was chosen as the  site and a church was dedicated June 8, 1914.&nbsp; It was very large with  space for 1000 worshippers.&nbsp; From then on the Affiliate was called  Lipiny- Wola Młocka.&nbsp; It became an independent parish April 1, 1933.</p>
