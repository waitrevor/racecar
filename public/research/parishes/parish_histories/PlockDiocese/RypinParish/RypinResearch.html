    <p>Linda Pauling has extracted a list of over 800 immigrants who migrated from the Dobriner region to North America via Ellis Island. This list was developed by researching the locations provided and therefore is not guaranteed to be complete. The information is extracted in its entirety so the pdf file is very wide. It is unlikely that you will be able to print it off on a standard home computer. </p>
