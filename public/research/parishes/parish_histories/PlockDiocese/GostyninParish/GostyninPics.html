              <span>The  town authorities of Gostynin have established a foundation for the  purpose of restoration or reconstruction of the old Castle of  Gostynin.&nbsp; The castle dates back to the end of the 14th century.&nbsp; In  the course of time it was used for many purposes, in the beginning it  was the seat of the local government and was visited by several Polish  kings.&nbsp; Some decades later it also served as a prison, and the most  prominent prisoners were the Russian czar Vassyli Szujski and his  brothers Dymitri and Ivan in 1611.&nbsp; The castle was often reconstructed,  but after the second half of the 17th century the castle fell into  ruin.&nbsp; In 1824 the government donated the ruins to the Lutheran  parishioners of Gostynin, who built the Lutheran church on the site of  the castle, in part making use of the remaining walls.&nbsp; [<em>According  to Eduard Kneifel the building costs amounted to 3,513 Rubels, of which  the government paid two thirds, while the rest was paid by the  parishioners.</em>]&nbsp; The church was used by the Roman-Catholic community  until 1978, after which time it apparently was allowed to fall into  ruin again.<br>
              <br>
            The reconstruction plans have been made  by Ryszard Piosik, a well-known architect from Plock.&nbsp; It is one of the  objectives of the foundation that the reconstructed castle will become  the main tourist attraction of Gostynin, housing a conference center,  hotel, and gastronomic restaurants.<br>
            <br>
            However, the foundation does not have sufficient financial means to  embark on such a huge task on its own.&nbsp; Therefore, the foundation asks  for financial aid from the citizens of Gostynin, as well as from  countrymen who are now living in other parts of Poland or abroad.<br>

          <p><strong>Mokro Niemieckie</strong><br>
          The village of Mokro Niemieckie was north of Gostynin. It existed up until WW II but was abandoned and all houses were either destroyed or dismantled for use elsewhere. It had been located in the middle of a forest. After the War, it became a nature preserve and the land was allowed to return to its former forested state. Old maps showed a cemetery north of the village which also became overgrown and disused. </p>
          <p>In 2012, Jerry Frank, his son Rodney, and his brother Clarence attempted to find the village and cemetery. Correspondence and pictures from several years previous suggested that there were at least remnants of the cemetery in the forest. They parked at Biale on the southern edge of the forest and, armed with their old maps, walked in, using trails that at one time were the roads that led to several villages within the forest. After a 2 km walk, they were in the region of the village location. Searching for over an hour in that area on a very hot day in May provided no results. They found no signs of a former village or a cemetery. </p>
          <p>After returning home, Jerry managed to contact a German and Polish persons living in the Gostynin region who were interested in the local history of this area. They in turn contacted local forest rangers who helped them to find it. It turns out that it was only about 100 m from the area searched in May - less than a city block. The forest rangers arranged for the cemetery site to be cleared and the result can be seen below. Jutta Dennerlein, webmaster of the <a href="http://www.upstreamvistula.org/index.htm">Upstream Vistula</a> website later visited the site and shared some pictures with us.</p>
