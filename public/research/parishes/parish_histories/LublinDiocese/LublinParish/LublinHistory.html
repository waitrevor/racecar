    <h2>LUBLIN Church History</h2>
    (courtesy of Roland Fogt)
    <p>The  Protestant community in Lublin and the surrounding area has existed  since the middle of the 1500's. However, at this time there was no  actual church here. The Parish used the church in neighboring Piaski  and in the distant town of Nejdorf, across the Bug River (later known  as Moscice). In the year 1564 the pastors referred to the parish as the  parish of Lublin and Nejdorf. </p>
    <p>After a long-time effort,  the Protestants of Lublin attained the permission to erect an  independent parish in Lublin by the decree of King Stanislaw  Poniatowski on the 25th of August 1784. Construction was begun on the  church as well as a school, hospital and parsonage. Pastor Tobias Bauch  of Nejdorf, who led the project, moved from Nejdorf to the new parish.  Construction was finished in 1788 under the direction of August  Zynchert. The grateful parishioners created a carved portrait of King  Stanislaw, which was set in a finely carved golden frame and hung in a  place of honor within the church. From the church in Piaski, the pulpit  was brought to the new church. The altar was constructed in the Louis  the XV style and includes a depiction of Christ made in 1628.</p>
    <p>Church  bells were then installed. These bells, made in 1784, were donated by  Paul and Sofie Suchodolski from the town of Stryj. During the Russian  invasion of 1915, the bells were looted. Thanks to the inscription on  the bells they were recovered in 1923. The bells still serve the church  to this very day. </p>
    <p>The first organ was donated by Jan  Piaskowski in 1819 and served the church for almost 100 years. In 1912,  the organ was replaced with a newer model made by the E. F. Waicker  company. After being refurbished in 1988 by the Oberlinger Company, the  organ is still in service today. </p>
    <p>Nowhere in this region  was a church with so many valuable liturgical objects from the 17th and  18th century. But through the years of war and turmoil they were lost  or destroyed. Many of these objects were documented in the "  Illustrated Guide to Lublin " published in Warsaw, 1901. Included in  this guide are photos of the altar, pulpit and carving of King  Stanislaw. Also located within the church are memorial plaques for  former ministers and parishioners. </p>
    <p>It is noteworthy  that this church has served both Lutheran and Evangelical Reformed  parishioners. One of the first plaques as you enter on the left is  dedicated to Pastor August Diehl. Pastor Diehl was the Protestant  Superintendent of the Reformed Church of Congress Poland while at the  same time serving as the Protestant administrator of Lublin. In keeping  with old Polish tradition, metal plaques of former parishioners adorn  the church vestibule leading to the choir loft. The plaques include  names of the former Protestant aristocracy. Some of the names listed  include; Adam Suchodolski, Fryderyk Wilhelm Hermson - Squire of  Czechowka, Jan David Heissler, Jerzy Frifsch, Jan Baranski, Krzystof  Korn and Jan Piaskowski. Other plaques include entire Protestant  Families who donated to the common good of the parish and region. The  Vetter family, for example, were the main donors to the hospital and  school, two institutions that still serve the community today. Other  institutions, such as the Economics School on Bemardynska Street and  the hospital on Staszica Street, benefited from the generosity of such  parish families as Krauss, Schollz, Haberlau, Sauter, Jaeger,  Piaskowski, Baranski and many others. </p>
    <p>The Protestant  faithful always put value on higher learning of literature and culture.  These themes coincide for a better understanding of the teachings of  the Bible and its application to daily life. Donations to the  Protestant Lublin schools allowed the students to excel not only in  reading, writing and mathematics, but in agriculture, trade and  handcraft as well. They instituted numerous libraries, hospices and  charitable organizations. In 1913, for example, Jan Piatowski donated a  spacious classroom and a library. There were four primary schools of  business and 21 church parishioners ran their own farms or schools in  the area. Protestant schools were often the only schools in larger  rural areas. For example, in the area of Sobieszczany, the only school  for its 7,000 inhabitants was Lutheran based. </p>
    <p>In the  year 1913, the parish counted 8857 members, 410 of whom were from  Lublin. The parish included a masonry rectory, three canonical houses,  a general hospice, 2 acres of land and a garden in Belzyce. Also  included were 3 smaller churches in the outlying areas, 4 elementary  schools, 21 smaller houses of worship with schoolrooms and lay clergy  living quarters, 166 acres of arable farmland and 40 cemeteries, three  of which were in Lublin. </p>
    <p>During World War I, the parish  experienced severe devastation. Church buildings were destroyed and  many parishioners were deported. As mentioned earlier, the church bells  were looted. The devastation resulted in only 519 remaining  parishioners in 1915, and the parish began to fall into disrepair. With  the end of World War I and the onset of Polish independence, the parish  began to revive. In 1919 the church records indicated 5,051  parishioners. The parish began to develop again and many of the  faithful were recognized and awarded for their defense of their  homeland. </p>
    <p>In 1934, under the veteran leadership of Dr.  Alexander Schoneich and Bronislava Vetter, the Society of Protestant  Youth was formed. Dr. Schoneich served as honorary chairperson, and  Albert Froelich as chairman. Bronislava Vetter and Jan Krausse were  responsible for administration of services. It is fortunate that the  parish was able to reestablish itself with veteran parishioners in key  positions of leadership. </p>
    <p>In 1922, the parish church was  once more listed as an important site in the city of Lublin. Also of  importance were the numerous gravesites that the parish had established  in its cemetery, which was first begun in 1898. It was during World War  2 that the parish experienced the worst devastation of its history.  Ministers and parishioners alike were imprisoned. It was on October  3rd, 1939 that the Nazis arrested Bishop Juliusz immediately after  holding services. The Polish - Protestant parishes ceased to exist. As  result of the war, the parish experienced unimaginable losses of life  and property. Church documents, certificates and holy objects were lost  and destroyed. The church buildings fell victim along with the parish  itself. </p>
    <p>In 1944, as the war drew to a close, a small  group of the Lublin Protestant faithful began to reestablish the  parish, both spiritually and physically. On Christmas Eve of this year,  Fr. Rysard Trenkler from Warsaw held a Polish church service in Lublin.  In 1945, the former Dachau inmate Waldemar Lucer became the first  Protestant minister of the Lublin parish. Since then, a small group of  the Protestant faithful from Lublin and the surrounding area have  carried on with great difficulty preserving their poor parish and  church. Fortunately for the parish, the following members of the city  council were parishioners as well: Edward Schoitz (surgeon), Gustav  Haberlau (pharmacist), Karol Freybeig (businessman). </p>
    <p>Although  the church succeeded to revive, it was a time of severe disadvantage  for the parish. Many of its former parishioners were scattered around  the world and the parish did not recover its former property and  holdings. In the past years, particularly since 1976, important repairs  and renovations have been initiated, especially that of the church  organ. The life of the parish itself has intensified. It has succeeded  not only in stopping the membership decline, it has begun a slight  increase. The history of the parish is being revived and important  tasks, such as the church cemetery gravesite categorizing and  refurbishing are being accomplished. Parish members are attending  international conferences and meetings of the Protestant faith. The  church has welcomed representatives of the Roman Catholic faith as well  as missionaries and foreign preachers who have spoken to the faithful.  Ecumenical church services and evening-prayer singings take place.  Under the leadership of Sylwia Irgowa, district council leader, the  work of the Ecumenical Commission of Christian Women has had an  excellent impact. There is also community - orientated activities for  the parishioners were they can work for the common good of the  community in a spiritually beneficial and wholesome environment.  Outside of church - sponsored activities, the parish also makes  available their prayer house for theater groups and music concerts. The  parish is open to Christians both here and abroad for ecumenical  cooperation.</p>
