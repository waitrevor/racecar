    <p>Settlement  and history â€“ The German-Evangelical Weber Kolonie (Weaver colony) of  Hilsbach-Czarnylas was created in 1802, 8km north of  Czestochowa-Tschenstochau. And Czech weavers from Prussian Silesia  settled the town of Kamienica Polska.</p>
    <p>The nearest  Evangelical parish was in Wielun (65 km), so births, deaths, etc. were  registered in the Catholic Parish until 1846 when the affiliate of  Hilsbach-Czarnylas was formed. This Parish centre was transferred to  Czestochowa- Tschenstochau in 1852.</p>
    <p>There was one church, 2 prayer halls, 5 cemeteries and 2 schools with Polish instruction before WWII.</p>
