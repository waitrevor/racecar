    <h2>Affiliate of Kamocin</h2>
    <p>Settlement and history - German  Lutheran colonists built a school and a prayer hall in Kamocin in 1830.  Kamocin is 10 km from Petrikau. The Lutheran community stayed small  because of a strong Baptist presence. But in 1873-74 Kamocin, together  with surrounding villages was formed into an affiliate of Petrikau. A  church as well as a school were built. Their new church was  innaugurated in 1881.</p>
