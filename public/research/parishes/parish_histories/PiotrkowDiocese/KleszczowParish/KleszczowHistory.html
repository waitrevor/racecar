    <h2>Kleszczow</h2>
    <p>Settlement and history - Evangelical  Lutheran settlers of German, and Polish nationalities as well as Czechs  of the Reformed faith bought the Dominium Kleszczow in 1818. They came  from Prussian Silesia and the Province of Posen. A number of villages  were formed. The more affluent Evangelical farmers settled the better  soil of Kleszczow, Kucow and Folwark (Nowe Folwarki). The poorer  colonists settled in the sandier soil of Stawek (Stawki), and Rogowiec  (Pustkowie-Rogowiec).</p>
    <p>In addition to these original  settlers there also came colonists from the parishes of Lask, Wielun  and Belchatow. Single Evangelical Czech and Polish families also  settled in the surrounding towns of Kleszczow, Kucow, Luszczanowice,  Zlobnica, , Folwark, Janow and Wiewiec.</p>
    <p>The actual  foundation of the parish did not take place until 1847. Before that the  Catholic Church performed marriages and baptisms.</p>
    <p>The affiliate Dziepolc was bound to Kleszczow in 1853.</p>
    <p>There was 1 church, 3 prayer halls, 13 cemeteries.</p>
