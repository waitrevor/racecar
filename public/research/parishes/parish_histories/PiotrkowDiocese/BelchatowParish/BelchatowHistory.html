    <p>Settlement  and history – The German colonies of Rassy Hol., Kalduny Hol. and  Myszaki Hol. in Petrikau were first settled in 1795. Other colonies  followed in the Belchatow area, including – Huta Poraj, Pawlow szkolny,  and Szkolwierzyniec. But the first German evangelical Tuchmacher (cloth  makers) and Handwerker (craftsmen) did not arrive until 1804. The same  occurred in the nearby small city of Grocholice.</p>
    <p>A much  stronger colonization by German Evangelicals is apparent in 1824 to  1830 when evangelical entries in the Catholic Church books are very  evident. The first evidence of an organized Evangelical Church in the  Belchatow area dates to 1820. But the first Belchatow Parish was not  established until 1837. Kle which had been part of the parish, broke  away in 1847 and in 1850 Belchatow absorbed the former Reformed Church  members of Zelow.</p>
    <p>A mass exodus occurred from the parish  between 1870 and 1875, and most of these souls headed for Volhynia.  Whole settlements uprooted including Zwierzyniec, Stoki, Wola,  Mikorska, Janow, Rassy, Kelchenhof.</p>
