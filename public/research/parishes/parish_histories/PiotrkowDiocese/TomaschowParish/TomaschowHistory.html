    <h2>Tomaschow Parish</h2>
    <p>Settlement and history - The oldest  German colony in the area was Laczkowice. It was established in 1797.  Almost simultaniuosly, the colony of Maksymow was formed to the south.  The colonies of Wykno, Ciosny and Lipkianki followed in 1818. These  communities were very small farming communities until 1815 when a  “Fabriktores” (factory complex ?) was formed in Tomaschow. The  government seat was located in Ujazd Ostrowskis until 1812 when it was  moved to Tomaschow. From 1821 onwards the area administrators actively  sought out Tuchmachers from the Grunberg, Sagan, and Gorlitz areas.  Most of these new colonists settled in Ujazd.</p>
    <p>The parish  was not formed until 1830. In 1863 the parish organized the affiliate  of Wielka-Wola situated across the river from Tomaschow parish. The  following villages belonged to this affiliate: Konstantynow, Blogie,  Skorkowek, Opczno, and Feliksow. This affiliate was dissolved and  absorbed into the parish in 1878 because of a large-scale exodus of  Germans to Volhynia.</p>
    <p>The parish consisted of 2 churches, 20 cemeteries, 11 prayer halls.</p>
