    <h2>Piotrkow</h2>
    <p>Settlement and history - Piotrkow Parish was  founded in 1796 in the form of Kantorat Leonow. But it wasn’t  officially inaugurated until 1813. A large number of Prussian  officials, military personnel and craftsmen settled here after the  second partition of Poland in 1793. A number of Evangelical Lutheran  villages were established around the City of Petrikau . They were  served by the military parish until the regular parish was established.  Even then, until the end of Prussian rule, the regular parish was  served by a military pastor.</p>
    <p>From 1807 to 1824 the parish  became “orphaned” and was served by periodical visits from pastors of  the Lask, Bruzyca, and Ilow Parishes.</p>
    <p>In 1852 the parish  formed the affiliate of Przedborz. In 1857 the parish formed the  affiliate of Pilica, and in 1874 the affiliate of Kamocin.</p>
    <p>There were 2 churches, 6 prayer halls and 7 cemeteries.</p>
