    <h2>Wielun Parish</h2>
    <p>Settlement and history - Wielun is one  of the oldest cities in Poland and played an important role during the  time of the Reformation. During the Reformation period, and after,  there was a strong Kalvanist Parish in Wielun, Parcice and Mielecin.</p>
    <p>During  South Prussian rule of the area, a number of Polish Lutheran and German  Lutheran farmers, craftsmen and workers moved into the area. The Poles  came from the provinces of Posen and Oberschlesien (Upper Silesia), the  Germans came from Niederschlesien (Lower Silesia), Prussia and Pommern.  Their religious centre was in the town of Krzeczow and they established  the parish in 1820. In 1859 they built their first permanent (brick)  church. In 1824 Wielun established their first fine linen factory.</p>
    <p>The  Lutheran parish dwindled in size from 1848 onwards due to many deaths  and a steady stream of emigrants later. The colony of Barczew was added  to the parish in 1854. That same year the Affiliate of Panki and the  Kantorat of Marianow were created. These two stayed affiliated with  Wielun until 1876.</p>
    <p>This parish was mixed ethnically and services were held in Polish and German in some towns as well as just Polish in others.</p>
