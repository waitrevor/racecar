    <p>Settlement  and history - Evidence of Evangelical Lutheran settlers in the Lask  area exists from the beginning of 1800. Germans from Posen, Thuringen,  Sachsen, and Pommern settled new villages in the area. The parish of  Lask and surrounding towns was formed in 1809. It appears that the  Parish had a hard time retaining a Pastor and from 1824 to 1927 the  parish bacame affiliated with the Parish of Zdunska-Wola, whose pastor  visited once a month to conduct parish business. During that time, from  1839 to 1855 the pastor of Pabiance also conducted parish business. So  much of the recording of births and marriages is in surrounding  parishes.</p>
    <p>There were 2 churches (Lask and Chorzeszow), 3  prayer houses (Rokitnika, Zabloty, Drzewociny), 2 prayer halls  (Anielin, Okup), and 7 cemeteries.</p>
