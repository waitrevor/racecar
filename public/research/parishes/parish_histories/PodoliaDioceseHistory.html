    <h2>The Parish of Nemirow (1782)</h2>
    <p>This  parish covered all of Podolia except for the Parish of Dunajewzy, which  was formed in 1864. It was established in 1782 by Graf Vinzent Porocki,  the Polish Lord of the Royal Chamber (<em>Kronkammerherr</em>). A church  was built by 1801, but it, along with the rectory and school, was  destroyed by fire in 1811. The fire also destroyed much of the town.  Recovery was difficult and the population (largely cloth and leather  workers) declined to a low of 65. Even the pastor lived elsewhere for a  time. A new rectory was built in 1821, followed by a new brick church  in 1842, built by Graf Boleslaw Potocki. The cantorate then burned down  in 1870, and was rebuilt, with donations from Graf Stroganow and the  Consistory’s Sustentation Fund, in 1881.</p>
    <p>In 1846 a brick  church was built in Kamenka (about 60 miles from Nemirow) by the family  of the dying General Fieldmarshal Wittgenstein, who was subsequently  buried there. It was renovated in 1901 by Prince Wittgenstein, its  patron.</p>
    <p>As of 1905, this parish served approximately 2,000 ethnic German parishioners.</p>

    <h2>The Parish of Dunajewzy (1864)</h2>
    <p>This parish lay in the <em>uezd</em> Uschiza and Kamenez. Early in the 19th century, German artisans settled  in Dunajewzy, about 20 miles from Kamenez. They were served by the  pastor from Nemirow. Following the Polish uprising of 1831,  General-Adjutant Graf Krassinske acquired 35 cloth-workers and their  families from Posen, Brandenburg, Silesia, Saxony and Württemberg on  the promise of a church and a pastor for themselves. Hindered in his  plans, he sold Dunajewzy to a Polish nobleman, Bronislaw Stibinewski.  The purchase price included 13,000 Rubles for the construction of a  church and rectory. Forced by the law to honor his contract,  Stibinewski did build the church and became its patron. After seven  years of work, it was dedicated in 1866. It seated 520. By decree of  the Minister of the Interior, Dunajewzy, along with the neighboring  city of Kamenez-Podolsk, became an independent parish in 1864. A  rectory was completed in Dunajewzy in 1870. A stone church seating 150  was built in Kamenez-Podolsk in 1900. Altogether there were about 1,000  parishioners in this parish in 1904. About 900 lived in Dunajewzy, 150  in Kamenez-Podolsk, and about 14 in the town of Gorodok. The parish’s  church-school was in Dunajewzy.</p>
