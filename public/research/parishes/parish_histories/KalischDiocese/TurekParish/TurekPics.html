          <p>Gail provides the following story regarding the German Lutheran cemetery at Turek:<br>
          </p>
          <p>When we were in Poland in 1990 we noticed how beautifully kept the   cemeteries were, or rather, the Catholic cemeteries! Especially on   Sunday, you would see people taking care of the gravesites.&nbsp; We received directions from some ladies at the Evangelical   Lutheran Church and drove out to the cemetery, about 2 miles north.   There were some people working in a beautifully kept cemetery and I went   up to one of them with "Arndt" written on a piece of paper. She said   "Ach, Deutch!" and pointed north.&nbsp; There was another gate, with the   German/Protestant area separated from the Polish/Catholic cemetery by a   high wall. The entrance was not immediately seen, being hidden by large   trees.</p>
          <p> As we entered the cemetery, a path stretched before us,   surrounded by an overgrowth of weeds climbing over wrought iron fences,   around gravesites and across tombstones. Someone had placed a cross of   tree branches in the middle of the path about half way into the   cemetery. We searched among the graves for Karl and Barbara Arndt and it   was our good fortune to&nbsp; find them, with the added surprise of   marigolds: someone had planted flowers! We had come with a picture taken   of the grave before WWII and so had an idea what we looked for.</p>
          <p>A few years later we found out who was taking care of the   graves. It was the widow of Adolph, the son of Karl Arndt and his second   wife, Berta Ziegledorf. &nbsp;Adolph was a half-brother of my grandfather,   born in 1914 (the year my mother was born). Adolph married Marianna   (surname not known). He was&nbsp;sent to battle&nbsp;with the Polish Army in 1939   during the Nazi blitz of Poland in 1939 and they never heard from him   again. Left behind were Marianna and one son. Marianna married again,   continued to care for the graves of Karl and Barbara Arndt and in 2000   put the marble slab on it seen in the last picture. Marianna Pietrzyk is   pictured. The cemetery appears to be much better cared for in 2000 than   it was in 1990.&nbsp;</p>        </td>
