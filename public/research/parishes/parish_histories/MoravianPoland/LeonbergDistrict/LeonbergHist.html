    <h2>LEONBERG DISTRICT<br>
        </h2>
    <p><b>LEONBERG<br>
      </b>The earliest beginning of Moravian assemblies in Poland took place at Leonberg (Lwowek). This stemmed from a religious awakening in Leonberg, Wurttemberg around 1800. Three Moravian brethern responded to the call of Spreading the Gospel and migrated to Leonberg in Poland. Binz and Held were from Sindelfingen, Krater from Gerlingen. They held regular services with 30 to 40 local settlers attending.<br>
      <br>
      In earlier times, services in Leonberg and surrounding area were conducted by lay-workers with occasional visits by Pastors from Neusulzfeld. A prayer-hall was built in Leonberg in 1847. The U.A.C. in Berthelsdorf decided at this time to set-up the Neusulzfeld and Leonberg Districts. Pastor Karl Hessemer was called in 1857 for the Leonberg District. <br>
  <br>
      Plans were made to build a new church and residence at Leonberg. Hessemer visited the Neusulzfeld district to collect money for building materials. The church and house were dedicated in 1858.<br>
  <br>
      A new two-storey church was built in 1865. The older church was used for Sunday School, Bible Study, choir and band practises. Georg Queck, a neighbor with a large yard, built a stable to accommodate visitors who came long distances with horse and buggy during festivals. In 1897 and 1901, the church complex was enlarged and renovated.<br>
  <br>
      The 1863 Revolution brought fear and terror to the Leonberg settlement. Hessemer held services every evening to over-flowing crowds. Many refused to go home; instead, they stayed in church and slept on the floor. Russian soldiers passing through Leonberg provided some guns and ammunition for protection against the Poles. The Germans were caught in the middle of the up-rising as they did not support the Poles. Hessemer had to wait until the spring of 1864 before resuming his visits to Moravian settlements.<br>
  <br>
      Another former teacher from the Moravian Colony at Sarepta on the Volga, Hermann Steinberg, was called in 1878 to replace Hessemer. He served the spread-out district of Leonberg for 25 years with only a 13 month break when he was trying to establish a congregation in Volhynia.<br>
  <br>
      In 1908, Pastor Heinrich Schiller was sent to assist the work in the large Leonberg district. He resided in Stanislawow.<br>
  <br>
      Today, the church is a Catholic church and it is in good condition.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
      WW I struck a severe blow to German settlements in this area. In Jan 1915, they travelled to Modlin by wagon and then loaded into cattle cars to travel to Sarepta on the Volga. Life was difficult on their return as businesses and homes were ransacked.<br>
  <br>
      The dedication of lay-workers and hours of work that went into congregational life was outstanding. Duck Dinners in fall were well known in the area.

  <br>
      The Stanislawow congregation had a choir and band. Leadership in all of the church activities came from Samuel Schulz and his twelve sons. Work came to an end at this location in 1940 as many were re-settled to other areas.<br>
