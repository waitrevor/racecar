    From the yearly "Volhynian folk calendar" from 1935 to 1938 as written  by the Volhynian Lutheran Pastors. Note that, at this time, the  Lutheran Churches of western Volhyhnia were under the direction of the  Warsaw Consistory, not St. Petersburg. That is why you find Polish  information together with that from Volhynia.</p>
