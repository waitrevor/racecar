    <h2>The Parish of Tortschin (Torczyn) (1930)</h2>
    <p>Although it was a small town with only three Lutheran families, Tortschin was in the midst of other colonies with Lutheran congregations which were a considerable distance from the Parish seats of Roshischtsche, Luzk and Wladimir-Wolhynsk. . In 1929, with leadership from the Warsaw Consistory, it was decided that a new parish (with about 5,500 parishioners) should be formed from parts of these three parishes. Robert K Liersch, a vicar from Luzk, moved to Tortschin in that year. At an organizational meeting the following year, the new parish was founded by a vote of 85 to 18. Since there was no church building in Tortschin, worship services were held in the cantorates and marriages were held in Helenow and Janowka. In 1937 a rectory/chapel was completed, with seating for 200, in Tortschin, and Bishop Bursche officiated at its dedication. Pastor Liersch was arrested in 1939 and died under severe mistreatment in prison.</p>
