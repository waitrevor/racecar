    <p>1. <strong>Volhynia, Kiev, and Podolia Parish Record Index (VKP Databases)</strong><br>
    The three VKP  databases, Births &amp; Confirmations, Marriages, and Deaths, are indexes of  records from Lutheran churches that existed in Volhynia, Kiev, and Podolia from  the early 1800s until WW II.&nbsp; The data has  been extracted from church records held in St. Petersburg Archive in Russia and  from church records held in Archiwum Główne Akt Dawnych in Warsaw, Poland.&nbsp; For complete information on available  Lutheran church records for Volhynia and related areas see our <a href="https://www.sggee.org/research/parishes/church_parishes/LutheransInVolhyniaKievPodolia.html">parishes page</a>. </p>
    To search the VKP records, please use the links on our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sggee.org/SGGEE2009/research/PublicDatabases.html">public database</a>&nbsp;page. Additional databases of Volhynia records for 1900 to 1918 may be found on our <a href="https://www.sggee.org/SGGEE2009/members/Volhynia_1900-18.html">Volhynian 1900-1918 Archives Index</a> (for members only).
    <p><strong>St. Petersburg Archive</strong><br>
The records  in St. Petersburg Archive are the duplicate copies of parish register books  sent each year to the Lutheran Consistory office in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; The data was extracted in the 1990s by the  Odessa Group from LDS microfilm copies of the duplicate register books.&nbsp; The microfilms cover only to 1885 and some  years are missing.&nbsp; The Volhynian portion of the St. Petersburg Archives records index is  now&nbsp;hosted in the original form on the <a href="http://www.odessa3.org/"><strong>Odessa3 website</strong></a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Archiwum Główne Akt  Dawnych (AGAD)</strong></p>
      <p>AGAD &nbsp;holds  Lutheran church register books of Rozyszcze, Wladimir-Wolynsk, and Lutzk  parishes (all in the western or Polish part of Volhynia) and also books of some  kantorates in the above parishes and as far east as Rowno and Tutschin.&nbsp;The books begin with the founding of Rozyszcze parish in 1862 and extend to 1939 with some years missing.&nbsp; Digital scans of these records were made  available online about 2015 at <a href="http://www.agad.gov.pl/inwentarze/KsEA439x.xml">AGAD Volhynia Inventory</a>.&nbsp; SGGEE  volunteers extracted data from these records for inclusion in the VKP databases. For the convenience of researchers, the link to the online scan is included in the VKP databases for every entry that has an online scan. </p>

      2. <a href="http://remus.shidler.hawaii.edu/genes/">Bill Remus</a> offers data on the <strong>Kiev region, old Volhynia, Romansdorf, and central Volhynia</strong>.  His site includes a brief history, some maps and pictures, and some surname data.<br>
      <br>
      3. Extraction of <a href="http://www.odessa3.org/collections/churches/link/ilow.txt">confirmation records</a> from the <strong>Ilow Parish</strong> in Russian Poland, 1806-1814. The pastor from Ilow in this time frame  served a very large area prior to the establishment of Lutheran  Churches elsewhere. These records can hold vital clues about where  families were living at the time AND where the confirmand was born.</p>

<h2 class="quick-jump" id="EWZ Microfilms"><a name="ewz" id="ewz"></a>EWZ Microfilms</h2>
<p>The EWZ (Einwandererzentralstelle) records are those prepared by the Immigration Center of the German Reich for the years 1939-1945. They are especially relevant for families who voluntarily, or by force, returned to German territory from Eastern regions of Russia including Volhynia and Russian Poland. These records contain so much genealogical material that they can be relevant for family research even if your direct line left the regions many years before. The following links will take you to more detailed info and explain how to explore online resources available for these records.</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.volhynia.com">Volhynia.com</a> is a great starting place for details about this material and how to access it for research. Provided by Dave Obee who has presented this topic at numerous conventions. Follow the links near the lower center of the right hand column.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.odessa3.org/search.html">Odessa3</a> presents an extraction program focusing on Germans from Russia. The link takes you to their search page. Use the first search box and set it to search "War Records". You can also browse through the extractions using their <a href="http://www.odessa3.org/collections/war/">War Documents</a> page.  For Germans that were resettled from these regions of the Soviet Union (prior to World War II) an <a href="./2021_EWZ/2008SepJournal_EWZ.pdf" target="_blank">instructional article</a> from a 2008 issue of the SGGEE journal describes how one can use the search results from Odessa 3 to assemble families as listed on each Stammblatt. </p>
<p>3. FamilySearch has posted over 300,000 <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/252070?availability=Family%20History%20Library" target="_blank">EWZ Stammblätter</a> for resettled Germans from eastern Poland, Polish Volhynia, Galicia, Austria, and Sudetenland (Czechoslovakia). Using the <a href="https://invenio.bundesarchiv.de/invenio/login.xhtml" target="_blank">Invenio</a> resource in Germany, names of many people resettled through the action of EWZ can be searched with their Stammblatt number indicated. For detailed instructions on using Invenio and finding the corresponding Stammblätter see the <a href="./2021_EWZ/Invenio instructions.pdf" target="_blank">instructions</a> provided.</p>
<p>4. The <a href="http://www.galiziengermandescendants.org">Galizien German Descendants</a> site focuses their extractions on the Galicia region but they should not be overlooked as there is significant overlap with our regions of interest. Their EWZ extraction covers all parts of eastern Europe, not just Galicia. On their home page, click on "Researching our Galizien Descendants", then on "1939 Resettlement Records".</p>

<p>You  may know that your ancestors did not migrate to Volhynia or other areas  in Russia until after that date but you might find cousins who did so.  Even without knowing who that cousin is, a check on where a person with  your surname migrated from in Poland may lead to discovery of the  village where your ancestors lived. At the very least, the lists will  define where in Poland certain surnames existed.</p>
