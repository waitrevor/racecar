    <p>This  is a chronological listing showing the formation of  Evangelical-Augsburg (Lutheran) parishes in the territory of Congress  Poland. It should be noted that Congress Poland, also called Russian  Poland, existed between 1815 and appr. 1918, while the time period  shown below goes from 1617 until the beginning of WWII in 1939. The  parish formation is shown chronologically, interspersed with important  historical events that took place in Poland during the same period.  Lutheran parishes in other parts of Poland, lying outside of Congress  Poland, such as Volhynia, Silesia, West Prussia, etc., are not shown  here.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, this list will be helpful when trying to  find records of your ancestors who once lived in this area of Poland.  Filmed records from most of these parishes, although not for the whole  period mentioned, can be found using the <a href="#/research/parish.html">SGGEE parishes page</a>.</p>
    <p>If the records have not (yet) been filmed by the LDS, then check for links to the Polish Archives on the <a href="#/research/archive.html">SGGEE archives page</a>.</p>
    <p> If you are looking for records from a period before the formation of  the Lutheran parish, you may be able to find the data in the records of  the Roman-Catholic parish for that location. Also, please note that  records which are not yet 100 years old are neither filmed by the LDS  nor stored by the Polish State Archives. If they exist, they are held  by the local town authorities.</p>
