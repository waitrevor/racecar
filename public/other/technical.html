    <h2>Your Browser</h2>
    <p>This site should function correctly for the traditional browsers used in their current versions. All browsers have free upgrades and we recommend that you use the most current one available. If you find a page that does not seem to display correctly after you have upgraded, please report it to the <a href="mailto:webmaster-sggee@googlegroups.com">Webmaster</a> and we will try to get the problem corrected. <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Text Size</h2>
    <p>It is difficult to design a site with text size that suits all people.  There is a special problem with Internet Explorer in that it does not always use recognized design standards.  If the size is not right for you, please use your browser sizing function to change it.  In most cases, this will mean clicking - View &gt;&gt; Text Size - or similar, in your browser. </p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>In the transposition of the  site to the new format, we have attempted to ensure that all links function correctly.  If you find any broken links, please report them to the <a href="mailto:webmaster-sggee@googlegroups.com">Webmaster</a>.</p>
    <h2>Plug-ins</h2>
    <p>There are currently two browser plugins that are used at this site: DjVu and Acrobat. Read on to learn where to get these plugins and how to install them.</p>
    <p></p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Please note</b> that printing Acrobat from within your browser is accomplished with the toolbar icon, NOT with the print command found in the browser's file menu.</p>
    <p><i><b>Free Adobe Acrobat Reader (software and plugin)</b><br>
    </i>This plugin allows you to view documents in a format that maintains complete fidelity to its original format (usually items intended for print). As with the browsers, we recommend that you return to the Adobe site from time to time to download the most recent version of the Acrobat Reader.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Go To The Acrobat Reader Site<b> <img src="../images/getacro.gif" height="31" width="88" border="0"></b></a></p>
    <p><b>Instructions for obtaining and installing Acrobat Reader</b></p>
    <p>1. You must have Adobe’s free Acrobat Reader software installed. It is available for numerous platforms, including Macintosh, Windows, and many Unix systems. Clicking on the yellow link above will take you to Adobe’s web site. Select the operating system you use and click “Download.”</p>
    <p>2. Once you have Acrobat Reader downloaded, double-click the installation file and follow the instructions to install it. You will probably have to quit your web browser so that the installer can put a plugin for your browser in the proper place. This plugin will allow you to view the application form from within your browser.</p>
    <p>3. Go back to the page with the Acrobat file and click on it. Or, alternately, you may download the application to your hard drive and view it with the Acrobat Reader (without your web browser). To download the file for later viewing, either click and hold (Macintosh) or right click (Unix/Windows) and select <i>Save Link As...</i> in the popup menu (Netscape Navigator or Communicator).</p>

    <a name="djvu" id="djvu"></a><i><b>Free DjVu (deja vu) Plugin</b></i><br>
This plugin allows you to view text that has been scanned at very high resolution, but with very small file sizes and without visual artifacts introduced by other compression methods. As with the browsers, we recommend that you return to the Djvu site from time to time to download the most recent version of the Djvu Viewer.
<p>As an example of the compression involved, some of the documents on this site were originally scanned at 300 dots per inch (dpi), and occupied over 3MB as a TIFF file. They now take less than 130KB each. You <b>must</b> have the Djvu plugin installed on your computer in order to view these files. The Djvu plugin can be obtained by clicking on the icon:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.caminova.net/en/downloads/download.aspx?id=1"><img src="../images/plugin2.jpg" height="64" width="96" border="0"></a></p>
<p><b>Viewer Use Instructions</b><br>
  The viewer gives you the ability to zoom in on the image (up to 300%), print, change contrast and pan around. To see these options, do the following:</p>
<p><i>Macintosh:</i> With the mouse over the djvu image, hold down the Control key (and sometimes the Option key, if you have certain extensions installed) and then press and hold the mouse button to see the popup menu.</p>
<p><i>Unix and Windows:</i> With the mouse over the djvu image, click and hold down the right mouse button to see the menu popup.</p>
