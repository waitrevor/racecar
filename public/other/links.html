    <p><a href="Bonikowsky_Book.pdf">The Story of a Preacher from Russia</a> - by E.J. Bonikowsky<br>
    We are pleased to introduce the first book available by download on our website. It is presented unedited in its original form. Two small words of caution. It was written in the ethic of the day which may not be the same as today. Some descriptions of events may be disturbing to animal lovers and others. Also, the Baptists and Lutherans of the day were not known for being particularly friendly with each other. The severity of their animosity (which is not prevalent today) is not known but certainly there were complaints of mistreatment on both sides. This book is written from a Baptist perspective.</p>
    <p>Though over 100 pages long, we have managed to reduce the file size to less than that of a standard SGGEE Journal so your download time will not be too long. Read it on your computer or print it out. Our thanks to the Bonikowsky family for allowing us to publish the book here.</p>
