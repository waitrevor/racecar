    <p>We're sorry but must announce that our Bulletin Board has been discontinued. While it may have appeared to be very active with reports on the home page stating numerous "guests" being on line, in actual fact most of these were either search engines trolling the messages for indexing (legitimate) or spammers relentlessly attempting to gain access (illegitimate). Continuing regular maintenance of this part of the site is not deemed worth the results.</p>
    <p>In its place, we invite you to join our <a href="#/communicate/mailing_list.html">Mailing List</a> which is very active with over 700 subscribers.</p>
