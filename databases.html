    <h4><a name="lutheran" id="lutheran"></a>Lutheran Church Record Databases</h4>
    <p>1. <strong>Volhynia, Kiev, and Podolia Parish Record Index (VKP Databases)</strong><br>
    (as of March 2015, approximately 278,000 names in the births search, 41,500 names in marriages, 63,500 names in deaths)</p>
    <p>The core of the VKP database is the Volhynian portion of  the St. Petersburg Archives records index extracted over 10 years ago by many volunteers (including  many SGGEE members) and now &nbsp;hosted in the original form on the <a href="http://www.odessa3.org">Odessa3 website</a>.&nbsp;  This portion of the original data on the Odessa3 index contains BMD data for Zhitomir, Rozyszcze, and Heimtal parishes for  the years 1833 to 1885, with some years missing, approximately 72,000 line items.&nbsp; For more information, see our <a href="#/research/parishes/church_parishes/LutheransInVolhyniaKievPodolia.html">Volhynia Parishes</a> page.</p>
    <p>Starting with the core Odessa3 index for Volhynia, SGGEE has done the following:<br>
      - Recast the core index data somewhat for more flexible searching.<br>
    - Corrected some errors and added some missing data (comprehensive  checking was not done).<br>
    - Added data for Kiev  parish and Poldolia parish for 1833 to 1885 from St. Petersburg Archives  microfilms.</p>
    <p>And from microfilm copies (LDS films 2380017 to  2380038) of Volhynia register books held in the AGAD archive in Warsaw, SGGEE  has done the following:<br>
      - Added BMD data for the missing years for  Rozyszcze parish only.<br>
      - Added BMD data for Rozyszcze parish for  1886 to 1895 (M&amp;D), to 1899 (B). <br>
      - Added Confirmations for Rozyszcze parish  for 1862 to 1886.<br>
      - Added BMD data for Wladimir-Wolynsk parish  for 1891 to 1896 (B), to 1899 (M), to 1894 (D).<br>
      - Added BMD data for Tutschin (Tuczyn)  kantorate for 1849 to 1903 (B, D), to 1888 (M) with some years and parts of  years missing.<br>
	  - (Most recently – Nov 2016)  Added marriages for Rozyszcze parish only extracted from online scans of register books held in AGAD in Warsaw.  The years included are 1862 to 1909, except 1907. </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; For  Rozyszcze and Wladimir-Wolynsk parishes only, there is some duplication in data from the FHL (Family History Library) microfilms of the St. Petersburg Archive records, and the FHL microfilms of the AGAD records or the AGAD online scans..&nbsp; The BMD records held by AGAD, especially marriage records, may contain information not included in the St. Petersburg copy.</p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Data for this index was extracted by  volunteers from microfilm copies of hand-written church register books.&nbsp; Errors are inevitable and it is recommended  that the researcher check important results by viewing original records on the indicated microfilms. Also,  the microfilm record may contain information not given in the index entry.<p></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  The St. Petersburg Archive records and AGAD records have been digitally scanned and are available online – see the corresponding Lutheran Church Records in the <a href="https://www.sggee.org/research/parishes/church_parishes/LutheransInVolhyniaKievPodolia.html" target="_blank">Volhynia &amp; Related Regions</a> page for details.</p>

Members of SGGEE can select <a href="https://www.sggee.org/StPeteMember.html" target="_blank">St. Petersburg Consistory</a> to search the same  database using more <a href="#/StPeteMember.html">complex search strings</a> that allow for some  variation in spelling.

      3. Extraction of <a href="http://www.odessa3.org/collections/churches/link/ilow.txt">confirmation records</a> from the <strong>Ilow Parish</strong> in Russian Poland, 1806-1814. The pastor from Ilow in this time frame  served a very large area prior to the establishment of Lutheran  Churches elsewhere. These records can hold vital clues about where  families were living at the time AND where the confirmand was born.<br>

<h2 class="quick-jump" id="EWZ Microfilms"><a name="ewz" id="ewz"></a>EWZ Microfilms</h2>
<p>The EWZ (Einwandererzentralstelle) records are those prepared by the Immigration Center of the German Reich for the years 1939-1945. They are especially relevant for families who voluntarily, or by force, returned to German territory from Eastern regions of Russia including Volhynia and Russian Poland. These records contain so much genealogical material that they can be relevant for family research even if your direct line left the regions many years before. The following links will take you to more detailed info and some extractions.</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.volhynia.com">Volhynia.com</a> is a great starting place for details about this material and how to access it for research. Provided by Dave Obee who has presented this topic at numerous conventions. Follow the links near the lower center of the right hand column.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.odessa3.org/search.html">Odessa3</a> presents an extraction program focusing on Germans from Russia. The link takes you to their search page. Use the first search box and set it to search "War Records". You can also browse through the extractions using their <a href="http://www.odessa3.org/collections/war/">War Documents</a> page.</p>
<p>3. The <a href="http://www.galiziengermandescendants.org">Galizien German Descendants</a> site focuses their extractions on the Galicia region but they should not be overlooked as there is significant overlap with our regions of interest. Their EWZ extraction covers all parts of eastern Europe, not just Galicia. On their home page, click on "Researching our Galizien Descendants", then on "1939 Resettlement Records".</p>

<p>1. <a href="http://www.odessa3.org/collections/ships/link/verzeich.txt">Hopf list</a> of German migrants from the Kingdom of Poland (Russian Poland) to Russia in the years 1813-1866.  See also the <a href="http://www.odessa3.org/collections/ships/link/hopf2.txt">expanded version</a> which provides more detail about the individuals.</p>
<p>You  may know that your ancestors did not migrate to Volhynia or other areas  in Russia until after that date but you might find cousins who did so.  Even without knowing who that cousin is, a check on where a person with  your surname migrated from in Poland may lead to discovery of the  village where your ancestors lived. At the very least, the lists will  define where in Poland certain surnames existed.</p>
<p>2. Numerous resources for <a href="http://www.galizien-online.de/">Germans in Galicia</a> are available  (German language only). </p>

Note in particular, links to extractions by Georg Dorsher of Germans  from Russia travelling by way of Canadian ports of Quebec, Halifax and  St. John from 1900-1914. The Dorscher lists can be difficult to  research because the names are not listed alphabetically.

    <p>The search fields are as follows:<br>

      Erhverv = Occupation<br>

    <p>Only  one of these fields is needed for the search, but it would probably not  make much sense to search by other than "Efternavn", "Fødelokalitet",  and "Fødeland". When searching by "Fødeland", one has to use the Danish  country names:</p>
